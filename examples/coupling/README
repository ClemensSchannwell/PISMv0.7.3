PISM two-way coupling example
=============================

This directory contains a Python script, ``ebm`` implementing a very simple *energy balance model* for use with PISM's ``pismebm`` executable.

Its only purpose is to show that it is possible to couple PISM to external serial *boundary models* using files to pass data between PISM and a model it is coupled to **and** taking advantage of PISM's ability to run in parallel.

To try, run

::

  pisms -y 100 -o foo.nc -Mx 201 -My 201
  mpiexec -n 2 pismebm -ebm_command "./ebm -i ebm_in.nc -o ebm_out.nc" \
               -ebm_input_file ebm_in.nc -ebm_output_file ebm_out.nc \
               -update_interval 10 -i foo.nc
