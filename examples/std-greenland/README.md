## "Standard" Greenland spinup examples

This directory contains scripts for standard Greenland ice dynamics simulations.
The first section of the PISM _User's Manual_ documents these examples.  There
is one major run script `spinup.sh` but it takes options to determine major (and
minor) spinup choices.

These runs are motivated primarily by the "constant-climate" and "paleo-climate"
runs which are evaluated in

  * A. Aschwanden, G. Adalgeirsdottir, and C. Khroulev (2013). _Hindcasting to_
    _measure ice sheet model sensitivity to initial states._ The Cryosphere 7,
    doi:10.5194/tc-7-1083-2013, 1083--1093.

However, the runs here use 5km SeaRISE data including present-day bedrock
topography, ice thickness, and basal heat flux; see references at bottom.  Also,
in contrast to the above _Hindcasting_ paper, runs here use publicly-available
RACMO atmospheric/ocean circulation model outputs, including modeled present-day
2m air temperature, precipitation, and surface mass balance, as distributed by
the SeaRISE project; see reference at bottom.

## Basic usage

First do

    $ ./preprocess.sh

This downloads the file `Greenland_5km_v1.1.nc` from the SeaRISE site and it
builds PISM-readable NetCDF file `pism_Greenland_5km_v1.1.nc`.  It also
generates additional climate-forcing files `pism_dT.nc` and `pism_dSL.nc`.

Then do

    $ ./spinup.sh

*In fact this does no run of PISM*, but provides a usage message which you can
refer back to at any time.  It shows two basic usages, the first of which can
be run in a few minutes of computer time, so as to get started.

# SeaRISE Greenland background information

The SeaRISE assessment process included PISM Greenland simulations.  These runs
are described in these papers, which evaluate and compare all SeaRISE
simulations:

    _mass response to environmental change from the SeaRISE ice sheet modeling_
    _project: II. Greenland._ J. Geophys. Res.: Earth Surface 118 (2),
    doi:10.1002/jgrf.20076, 1025--1044.

    _environmental forcing and their use in projecting future sea-level_

The reference for RACMO model outputs is:

Scripts for the actual PISM submitted runs to SeaRISE can be found in the
`stable0.5` branch of PISM.  See
