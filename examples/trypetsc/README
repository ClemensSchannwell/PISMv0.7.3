This directory merely contains two PETSc example source codes.

Compiling and running these allows a user to test whether PETSc
itself is installed properly, as a way of testing
PETSc before building PISM.

The following should work if PETSc is installed properly:

$ make ex5
$ ./ex5
Number of Newton iterations = 4

ERRORS
-----------------------
If there is an error 
   "makefile: ... /bmake/common/base: No such file or directory"
or similar then
   ***  PETSC_DIR is not set properly  ***
   ***  see PISM install guide  ***

If there is an error
   "..../bmake/FOO/petscconf: No such file or directory"
or similar then
   ***  PETSC_ARCH is not set properly (as it is set to FOO)  ***
   ***  see PISM install guide  ***

DEVELOPER COMMENT
-----------------------
The example ex5.c is useful to PISM developers because
it shows use of SNES on a nonlinear PDE.

ex5.c has been modified to give poisson.c, which solves exactly the kind of
Poisson-like problem which is needed as a regularization step in inverse 
modeling (i.e. IceModel::computeYieldStressFromBasalShearUsingPseudoPlastic()
in src/base/iMinverseMat.cc).
