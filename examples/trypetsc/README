This directory merely contains a PETSc example source code.  This allows users
to test whether their PETSc is installed properly, perhaps as a way of testing
PETSc before building PISM.

The following should work if PETSc is installed properly:

$ make ex5
$ ./ex5
Number of Newton iterations = 4

ERRORS
-----------------------
If there is an error 
   "makefile: ... /bmake/common/base: No such file or directory"
or similar then
   ***  PETSC_DIR is not set properly  ***
   ***  see PISM install guide  ***

If there is an error
   "..../bmake/FOO/petscconf: No such file or directory"
or similar then
   ***  PETSC_ARCH is not set properly (as it is set to FOO)  ***
   ***  see PISM install guide  ***

DEVELOPER COMMENT
-----------------------
The example ex5.c is also useful to PISM developers because
it shows use of SNES on a nonlinear PDE.
