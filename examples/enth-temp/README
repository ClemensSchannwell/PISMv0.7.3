Enthalpy Formulation for Greenland (EFG) demonstrates the applicability of the
enthalpy formulation to the Greenland Ice Sheet

This directory contains the bash script efgrun.sh which does all the runs for
the paper "An enthalpy formulation for glaciers and ice sheets" by A. Aschwanden,
E. Bueler, C. Khroulev, and H. Blatter.

First, run examples/eisgreen/preprocess.sh from the PISM distribution to create the
input file "eis_green_smoothed.nc".  Then link to it.  Then run the script here.
In summary:

$ (cd ../eisgreen && ./preprocess.sh)
$ ln -s ../eisgreen/eis_green_smoothed.nc
$ export PISM_DO=echo          # in order to see what the run will do
$ ./efgrun.sh N                # N = number of processors
$ export PISM_DO=
$ ./efgrun.sh N >> out.efgrun  # do the run and save the stdout
