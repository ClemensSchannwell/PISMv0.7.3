Enthalpy Formulation for Greenland (EFG) demonstrates the applicability of the
enthalpy formulation to the Greenland Ice Sheet

This directory contains the bash script efgrun.sh which does all the runs for
the paper "An enthalpy formulation for glaciers and ice sheets" by A. Aschwanden,
E. Bueler, C. Khroulev, and H. Blatter.

First, run examples/eisgreen/preprocess.sh from the PISM distribution to get the
input file "eis_green_smoothed.nc".  Then

$ ./efgrun.sh N                # N = number of processors
