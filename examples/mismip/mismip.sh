# (or latest version of intercomparison description).

# This intercomparison describes a flow line ice stream and ice shelf
# system.  PISM is a 3D model so there is a notable lack of efficiency
# relative to flow line models.  Furthermore there is (for now) no 
# boundary layer or other advanced treatment of dynamics in the vicinity 
# of the grounding line; compare C. Schoof, (2007). "Marine ice-sheet
# dynamics. Part 1. The case of rapid sliding," J. Fluid Mech., vol. 573,
# pp. 27â€“55.

# See comments at start of src/ismip/iceMISMIPModel.cc regarding grounding
# line flux issues.

# A PISM MISMIP run always saves an ASCII file in the MISMIP specified format:
#   ABC1_1b_M1_A1_t
# and a standard PISM NetCDF file
#   ABC1_1b_M1_A1.nc
# If the run achieves steady state by the MISMIP criterion, then the run also
# saves two more ASCII files in the MISMIP spec format:
#   ABC1_1b_M1_A1_ss
#   ABC1_1b_M1_A1_f
# See intercomparison description (URL above) for format of these files.
