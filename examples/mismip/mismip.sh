# (or latest version of intercomparison description).

# This intercomparison describes a flow line ice stream and ice shelf
# system.  PISM is a 3D model so there is a notable lack of efficiency
# relative to flow line models.  Furthermore there is (for now) no 
# boundary layer or other advanced treatment of dynamics in the vicinity 
# of the grounding line; compare C. Schoof, (2007). "Marine ice-sheet
# dynamics. Part 1. The case of rapid sliding," J. Fluid Mech., vol. 573,
# pp. 27â€“55.

# See comments at start of src/ismip/iceMISMIPModel.cc regarding grounding
# line flux.
