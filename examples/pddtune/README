The scripts in this file demonstrate how to tune PDD parameters to match
regional climate model output available in a publicly-available data set.

The data set we use is the v1.1 version of the SeaRISE-Greenland data:
  http://websrv.cs.umt.edu/isis/images/a/a5/Greenland_5km_v1.1.nc
  
The fields "presprcp", "runoff", and "smb" (surface mass balance) in this data
set are from the RACMO/GR model.  They are described in this paper:
  Ettema J., et al. (2009), "Higher surface mass balance of the Greenland ice
  sheet revealed by high-resolution climate modeling", Geophys. Res. Lett.,
  36, L12501, doi:10.1029/2009GL038110

The tuning procedure is to adjust these PDD parameters; [X] is default value:
  pdd_positive_threshold_temp [273.15 K]
  pdd_factor_snow             [0.003 m K-1 day-1]
  pdd_refreeze                [0.6]
(See base_config.cdl for other PDD parameters which might be worth exploring.)

The top-level script is dotune.sh.  It calls:

  1.  preprocess.sh to download and clean-up metadata in the SeaRISE-Greenland
      file, in preparation for next steps; also runs ncgen on .cdl version of
      configuration file

  2.  boot.sh to create a PISM-output file of the type pclimate can read
  
  3.  it runs over ranges of parameters, generating cases and calling for each one:
         a) runcase.sh to call pclimate and generate PISM's smb
         b) climmask.py to mask out ocean areas AND ETC
         c) FOO.py TO COMPUTE OBJECTIVE FUNCTION
         d) AND IT WRITES RESULTS INTO A FILE, MAYBE
