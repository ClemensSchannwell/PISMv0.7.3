Welcome to PISM!

All information about PISM can be found at

   www.pism-docs.org
   
To download the trunk, namely "pism-dev", use subversion:

   svn co http://svn.gna.org/svn/pism/trunk pism-dev

For complete installation instructions get the PISM Installation Manual (PDF)
from www.pism-docs.org.

Intallation high points:  PETSc (http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) must be
installed and functioning before PISM can be built.  In fact we assume now that
PETSC_DIR and PETSC_ARCH are set properly.

To install PISM locally (in the PISM source tree), do

  $ cd pism-dev
  $ make
  $ export PATH=${PWD}/bin:${PATH}

You can check that PISM executables can be found by running:

  $ which pismr

and this should tell you a directory in which executable "pismr" is found.

Now run a simplified geometry experiment on 1 processor:

  $ pisms

Everything is working if this run goes for 1000 model years and ends with
"... done with run".

With 2 processes:

  $ mpiexec -n 2 pisms

To get source code updates including bug fixes, and build and install them, do

  $ svn up
  $ make

Please see the Installation Manual for more information on the build process.

The PISM User's Manual will explain most of what you want to know to do ice
sheet modeling.  Find it at www.pism-docs.org.

If you have questions about PISM usage, installation, or creating new models,
e-mail us at <help@pism-docs.org>.
