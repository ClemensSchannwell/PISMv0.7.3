Welcome!

PETSc must be installed and functioning before PISM can be built.
See http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-as/.

Assuming PETSC_DIR and PETSC_ARCH are set properly:

  $ cd pism0.1                [or "cd pism-dev" etc.]
  $ make
  $ make install

Note "make install" does not require root permission, as it only installs 
to ./{lib,bin}

If FFTW is not available do "export WITH_FFTW=0" before make.

More complete installation information, including on installing
PETSc and other libraries used by PISM, is in the first section of the PISM 
User's Manual: http://www.pism-docs.org/manual.pdf
