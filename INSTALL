Welcome to PISM!

All information about PISM can be found at

   www.pism-docs.org
   
To download the latest stable release use git:

   git clone git://github.com/pism/pism.git pism0.4

For complete installation instructions get the PISM Installation Manual (PDF)
from www.pism-docs.org.

Intallation high points:  PETSc (http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) must be
installed and functioning before PISM can be built.  We assume now that
PETSC_DIR and PETSC_ARCH are set properly.

To install PISM locally (in the PISM source tree), do

  $ cd pism0.4
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ ccmake ..     # hit 'c' to see initial config, 'c' again to configure,
                  # and then 'g' to generate once settings look right
  $ make install

You can check that PISM executables can be found by running:

  $ which pismr

and this should tell you a directory in which executable "pismr" is found.

Now run a simplified geometry experiment on 1 processor:

  $ pisms

Everything is working if this run goes for 1000 model years and ends with
"... done with run".  Again but with 2 MPI processes:

  $ mpiexec -n 2 pisms

A more thorough test of the build runs a suite of software/regression tests,
but this requires tools (including python and NCO):

  $ make test

Please see the Installation Manual at www.pism-docs.org for more information on
the build process.  The PISM User's Manual, also at www.pism-docs.org, will
explain most of what you want to know to do ice sheet modeling with PISM.

If you have questions about PISM usage, installation, or creating new models,
e-mail us at <help@pism-docs.org>.
