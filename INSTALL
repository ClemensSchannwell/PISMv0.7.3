Welcome to PISM!

All information about PISM can be found at

   www.pism-docs.org
   
To download the trunk, namely "pism-dev", use subversion:

   svn co http://svn.gna.org/svn/pism/trunk pism-dev

For complete installation instructions get the PISM Installation Manual (PDF)
from www.pism-docs.org.

Intallation high points:  PETSc (http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) must be
installed and functioning before PISM can be built.  In fact we assume now that
PETSC_DIR and PETSC_ARCH are set properly.  If FFTW is not available do 
"export WITH_FFTW=0".

Now do this to check for updates and build and install:

  $ make update install # puts PISM binaries in /usr/local/bin/ and
                        #   /usr/local/lib/, which may require root permission
  
If you want to specify a directory where PISM executables should be put, for
example into ~/usr/local/, it looks like this:

  $ PISM_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/usr/local cmake ..
  $ make update install
  $ PATH=~/usr/local/bin/:$PATH     # PATH sees the PISM executables

You may want to add lines

  export PISM_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/usr/local
  export PATH=~/usr/local/bin/:$PATH

to your .bashrc or similar.

You can check that the PISM executables can be found by something like:

  $ which pismr

and this should tell you a directory in which executable "pismr" is found.

Now run a simplified geometry experiment with 2 processes

  $ pisms

Everything is working if this run goes for 1000 model years and ends with
"... done with run".

With 2 processes:

  $ mpiexec -n 2 pisms

To get source code updates including bug fixes, and build and install them, do

  $ make update install


We have written a PISM User's Manual (PDF) which will explain most of what
you want to know.  We hope.  Find it at www.pism-docs.org.
