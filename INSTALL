Welcome!

PETSc must be installed and functioning before PISM can be built.
See http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-as/.

Assuming PETSC_DIR and PETSC_ARCH are set properly:

  $ cd pism0.1                [or "cd pism-dev" etc.]
  $ make
  $ make install

Note "make install" does not require root permission, as it only installs 
to ./{lib,bin}

If FFTW is not available do "export WITH_FFTW=0" before make.

More complete installation information, including on installing
PETSc and other libraries used by PISM, is in the first section of the PISM 
User's Manual: http://www.pism-docs.org/manual.pdf

An unsupported alternative is to use the SCons build process.  SCons 
is more intelligent about recompiling files and managing shared libraries, 
so it might be more robust.  Bear in mind, however, SCons is not the official 
build method, so it is not always up to date.

### build and install Pism executables in $dir/bin with libraries in $dir/lib
$ scons install	prefix=$dir 	 # no prefix argument is equivalent to `prefix=.'

Or, if you do not already have SCons installed:

$ (cd config && tar xf scons-local-0.97.tar.gz) # unpack a local copy
$ config/scons.py      				# invoke the local scons

SCons examples:

$ scons exact 	     	         # build the simple* executables with shared
                                 #   library in $dir/lib
$ scons extras			 # build some extras
$ scons pgrn	 		 # build only the Greenland executable
$ scons install-lib prefix=$dir  # put just the libs there
$ scons install-bin prefix=$dir  # put just the executables there
$ scons -c ~/usr prefix=~/usr	 # remove any files installed in the first step
