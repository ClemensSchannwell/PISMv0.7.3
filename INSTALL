Welcome to PISM!

All information about PISM can be found at

   www.pism-docs.org
   
To download the trunk, namely "pism-dev", use subversion:

   svn co http://svn.gna.org/svn/pism/trunk pism-dev

For complete installation instructions get the PISM Installation Manual (PDF)
from www.pism-docs.org.

Intallation high points:  PETSc (http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) must be
installed and functioning before PISM can be built.  In fact we assume now that
PETSC_DIR and PETSC_ARCH are set properly.

To install PISM locally (in the PISM source tree), do

  $ cd pism-dev
  $ make
  $ export PATH=${PWD}/bin:${PATH}

You can check that PISM executables can be found by running:

  $ which pismr

and this should tell you a directory in which executable "pismr" is found.

Now run a simplified geometry experiment on 1 processor:

  $ pisms

Everything is working if this run goes for 1000 model years and ends with
"... done with run".

With 2 processes:

  $ mpiexec -n 2 pisms

To get source code updates including bug fixes, and build and install them, do

  $ svn up
  $ make

(This will install an updated version of PISM in the source tree. Please see
the Installation Manual if you want to build and install out-of-source.)

We have written a PISM User's Manual (PDF) which will explain most of what
you want to know.  We hope.  Find it at www.pism-docs.org.

If you have quiestions about PISM, its installation or use, do not hesitate to
e-mail us at <help@pism-docs.org>.
