\title{Complete Bibliography for PISM}

\author{Ed Bueler}

\date{\today}

\begin{document}

\begin{abstract}
One purpose of this trivial document is to display the full contents of the 
bibliography file \texttt{ice\_bib.bib}.  Doing so also generates \texttt{fullbib.bbl}, 
which is useful when grabbing bibliography items for the \emph{Reference Manual}, 
for example.

This document cites everything: \cite{*}.

Based on PISM revision \PISMREV.
