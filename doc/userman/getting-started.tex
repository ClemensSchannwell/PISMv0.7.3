\subsection{Installing PISM}

To install PISM, see the \,\emph{Getting PISM}\, tab at \href{http://www.pism-docs.org}{\texttt{www.pism-docs.org}}.  Or use the PISM Installation Manual (PDF).\footnote{At \url{http://www.pism-docs.org/wiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=installation.pdf}.}

Once installed, the executable \texttt{pismr} should be available on your system's ``path''; confirm this with ``\texttt{which pismr}''.  The instructions below also assume you are using a \texttt{bash} shell (or one that accepts \texttt{bash} syntax).  The examples below assume you have the PISM source code in the directory ``\texttt{pism/}''.

\subsection{A Greenland ice sheet example}

We get started with an extended example showing how to generate initial states for prognostic model experiments on the Greenland ice sheet.  Ice sheet and glacier model studies often involve modeling present and past states using actions like the ones demonstrated in this section.  The particular choices made here are motivated by the evaluation of initialization methods in \cite{AschwandenAdalgeirsdottirKhroulev}.

We use data assembled by the \href{http://websrv.cs.umt.edu/isis/index.php/SeaRISE_Assessment}{Sea-level Response to Ice Sheet Evolution (SeaRISE)} group \cite{Bindschadler2013SeaRISE}.  SeaRISE was a community-organized assessment process providing an upper bound on ice sheet contributions to sea level in the next 100--200 years, especially for the IPCC AR5 report in 2013.

This example is a hands-on first look at PISM.  It is not an in-depth tutorial, and some details of what is happening will only be explained later.  The remainder of this manual lists PISM options, discusses nontrivial modeling choices, and explains the ways users may need to preprocess input data.

Some of the PISM output figures in this section were produced using a supercomputer.  Though the basic run here, on a rather coarse $20\,\textrm{km}$ grid, can be done on a typical workstation or laptop, PISM is designed to make high resolution possible by exploiting large-scale parallel processing \cite[among many other examples]{AschwandenAdalgeirsdottirKhroulev,Golledgeetal2012,Golledgeetal2013}.


\subsection{Input data for the Greenland ice sheet}

The NetCDF data used to initialize SeaRISE runs is freely-available online: 
\medskip

\centerline{\protect{\textbf{\url{http://websrv.cs.umt.edu/isis/index.php/Present_Day_Greenland}}}}
\medskip

\noindent The quickest way to get the file is to do
\begin{verbatim}
$ cd pism/examples/std-greenland
$ ./preprocess.sh
\end{verbatim}
\noindent The script \texttt{preprocess.sh} requires \texttt{wget} and also the NetCDF Operators (``NCO''; \url{http://nco.sourceforge.net/}).  It downloads the version 1.1 of the SeaRISE ``master'' present-day data set, which contains ice thickness and bedrock topography from BEDMAP \cite{BamberLayberryGogenini}, and modeled precipitation rates from RACMO \cite{Ettemaetal2009}, among other fields.

In particular, it creates three new NetCDF files which can be read by PISM.  The spatially-varying fields from the downloaded ``master'' file, with adjusted metadata, go in the PISM-readable file \texttt{pism_Greenland_5km_v1.1.nc}.  The other two new files contain famous time-dependent paleo-climate records from ice core and seabed core records; \texttt{pism_dT.nc} has GRIP \cite{JohnsenetalGRIP} while \texttt{pism_dSL.nc} has SPECMAP \cite{Imbrieetal1984}.

Any of these NetCDF files can be viewed with \texttt{ncview} or other NetCDF visualization tools; see Table \ref{tab:NetCDFview} below.  An application of IDV to the master data set produced Figure \ref{fig:sr-input}, for example.  Use \texttt{ncdump -h} to see the metadata and history of the files.

\end{figure}


\subsection{First run of PISM}   \label{subsect:runscript}  Like many Unix programs, PISM allows many command-line options.  Because PISM handles a wide variety of ice sheet, shelf, and glacier sub-models and configurations, the list of possible command-line options is long; see sections \ref{sec:boot} through \ref{sec:practical-usage} of this manual.  Therefore, in practice, one often builds scripts to run PISM with the correct options.

Our script is called ``\texttt{spinup.sh}''.  Initializing ice sheets can be done by computing approximate steady states with constant boundary data, or, in some cases, by integrating paleo-climatic and long-time-scale information to build a model for the present state of the ice sheet.  Both of these possibilities are illustrated in the \texttt{spinup.sh} script.  The spin-up stage may even require the most processor-hours, compared to a follow-on ``experiment'' or ``forecast'' stages.

We are ready to run PISM.  To see what can be done with the script, read the usage message it produces:
\begin{verbatim}
$ ./spinup.sh
\end{verbatim}

The simplest spin-up approach is to use a ``constant-climate'' model.  We take this approach first.  To see a more detailed view of the run we will do first, try:
\begin{verbatim}
$ PISM_DO=echo ./spinup.sh 4 const 10000 20 sia g20km_10ka.nc
\end{verbatim}
Setting the environment variable \texttt{PISM_DO} in this way tells \texttt{spinup.sh} just to print out the commands it is about to run, not do them.  The ``proposed'' run looks like this:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
mpiexec -n 4 pismr -boot_file pism_Greenland_5km_v1.1.nc -Mx 76 -My 141 \
  -Mz 101 -Mbz 11 -z_spacing equal -Lz 4000 -Lbz 2000 -skip -skip_max 10 \
  -ys -10000 -ye 0 -surface given -surface_given_file pism_Greenland_5km_v1.1.nc \
  -ocean_kill pism_Greenland_5km_v1.1.nc -sia_e 3.0 \
  -ts_file ts_g20km_10ka.nc -ts_times -10000:yearly:0 \
  -extra_file ex_g20km_10ka.nc -extra_times -10000:100:0 \
  -extra_vars diffusivity,temppabase,tempicethk_basal,bmelt,tillwat,csurf,mask,thk,topg,usurf \
  -o g20km_10ka.nc
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
Let's briefly deconstruct this run.

At the front is ``\texttt{mpiexec -n 4 pismr}''.  This means that the PISM executable \texttt{pismr} is run in parallel on four processes (e.g.~cores).  Though this example assumes you have a workstation or laptop with at least 4 cores, it will work with 1 to 100 processors, with reasonably good scaling in speed.  (Scaling can be good with far more processors if we run at higher spatial resolution.)  The executable name ``\texttt{pismr}'' stands for the standard ``run'' mode of PISM, in contrast to other, specialized modes described later (e.g.~in sections \ref{sec:verif} and \ref{sec:simp}).

Next, the proposed run uses option \texttt{-boot_file} to start the run by ``bootstrapping,'' a term describes the creation, by heuristics and highly-simplified models, of the complete initial conditions required for a deterministic, time-dependent ice dynamics model.  Then the options describe a $76\times 141$ point grid in the horizontal, which gives 20 km grid spacing in both directions.  Then there are choices about the vertical extent and resolution of the computational grid; more on those later.  After that we see a description of the time-axis, with a start and end time given: ``\texttt{-ys -10000 -ye 0}''.

Then we get the instructions that tell PISM to read the upper surface boundary conditions (i.e.~climate) from a file: ``\texttt{-surface given -surface_given_file pism_Greenland_5km_v1.1.nc}''.  For more on these choices, see subsection \ref{sec:climate-inputs}, and also the PDF PISM Climate Forcing Manual.

Following that there are longish options describing the fields we want as output, including scalar time series (``\texttt{-ts_file ts_g20km_10ka.nc -ts_times -10000:yearly:0}''; see section \ref{sec:practical-usage}), time- and space-dependent fields (``\texttt{-extra_file ...}''; again see section \ref{sec:practical-usage}), and finally the named output file (``\texttt{-o g20km_10ka.nc}'').

Now let's actually get the run going:
\begin{verbatim}
$ ./spinup.sh 4 const 10000 20 sia g20km_10ka.nc &> out.g20km_10ka &
\end{verbatim}
\noindent The terminating ``\verb|&|'' asks unix to run the command in the background, so we can keep working in the current shell.  Because we have re-directed the text output, PISM will show what it is doing in the text file \texttt{out.g20km_10ka}.  Using \texttt{less} is a good way to watch such a growing text-output file.


\subsection{Watching the first run}  \label{subsect:watchrun}  The next paragraphs describe what happens and what files are produced by the run which is underway.  The modeling choices represented here are reasonable, but they are not the only way to do it.  The user is encouraged to experiment; that is the point of a model!

As soon as the run starts it creates time-dependent NetCDF files \texttt{ts_g20km_10ka.nc} and \texttt{ex_g20km_10ka.nc}.  Actually the latter file spatially-dependent file is created after the first 100 years of model run, but that is a few seconds in this case.  In fact, the command \texttt{-extra_file ex_g20km_10ka.nc -extra_times -10000:100:0} will add a spatially-dependent ``frame'' at model times -9900, -9800, \dots, 0.  One way to get a snapshot of how many frames this file contains at any time is to do
\begin{verbatim}
$ ncdump -h ex_g20km_10ka.nc |grep "time ="
\end{verbatim}
but a more interactive way is to look at the output graphically with
\begin{verbatim}
$ ncview ex_g20km_10ka.nc
\end{verbatim}
In any case, we see that \texttt{ex_g20km_10ka.nc} contains ``movies'' of the fields chosen by the option \texttt{-extra_vars diffusivity,...,thk,topg,usurf}.  A frame of the ice thickness \texttt{thk} is shown in Figure \ref{fig:growing} (left).

The time-series file \texttt{ts_g20km_10ka.nc} is also growing.  It contains spatially-averaged ``scalar'' diagnostics like the total ice volume or the ice-sheet-wide maximum velocity (variable \texttt{ivol} and \texttt{max_hor_vel}, respectively).  It can be viewed
\begin{verbatim}
$ ncview ts_g20km_10ka.nc
\end{verbatim}
Generally PISM ``buffers'' its time series, so the file may only be updated when the buffer is full (see section \ref{sec:saving-time-series}), but, as the buffer is also cleared everytime a frame is written to an \texttt{-extra_file}, in this case the file \texttt{ts_g20km_10ka.nc} is updated frequently.  The growing time series for \texttt{ivol} is shown in Figure \ref{fig:growing} (right).

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\mbox{\includegraphics[height=5.0in,keepaspectratio=true]{ex-growing-thk-g20km}

\caption{Two views produced by \texttt{ncview} during a PISM model run for the Greenland ice sheet.  Left: Field \texttt{thk}, the ice sheet thickness, a space-dependent frame from file \texttt{ex_g20km_10ka.nc}.  Right: Time-series \texttt{ivol}, the total ice sheet volume, from file \texttt{ts_g20km_10ka.nc}. }
\label{fig:growing}
\end{figure}

After inspection of the fields in the diagnostic files \texttt{ex_g20km_10ka.nc} and \texttt{ts_g20km_10ka.nc}, the reader will agree that PISM can be asked to produce quite a bit of information about a run!

The whole first run takes about 20 minutes on a 2012-era 4-core laptop.  At the end of the run the output file \texttt{g20km_10ka.nc} is generated.

\label{fig:sr-spindone-map}
\end{figure}

FIXME The actual paleo-climate-driven spin-up starts from model state \texttt{g20km_steady.nc}.  We turn on three new mechanisms, climatic forcing, bed deformation, and improved stress balance.  There are two forms of climatic forcing. First, temperature offsets from GRIP core data affect the snow energy balance and thus rates of melting and runoff; the model is a simple temperature-index scheme described at the SeaRISE website.  Thereby the surface mass balance varies over time; in warm periods there is more marginal ablation.  Additionally, sea levels from the SPECMAP cores affects which ice is floating.

Significantly, we start using a more complete ice dynamics model with sliding controlled by a membrane stress balance, the SIA+SSA hybrid model described in section \ref{sec:dynamics}.  This is turned on with option ``\texttt{-ssa_sliding}''.

Also, we turn on a bed deformation model; the option is ``\texttt{-bed_def lc}''.  

These options are discussed in section \ref{sec:modeling-dynamics}.

FIXME: Over the course of the spin-up we have saved the modeled ice volume in ``time-series'' NetCDF files.  This important model output can be viewed by
\begin{verbatim}
$ ncview ts_g20km_m5000a.nc ts_g20km_0.nc
\end{verbatim}
\noindent Figure \ref{fig:sr-spindone-ivolboth} shows this ice volume time series for the whole spin-up.  We see the modeled volatility of ice volume in the late ``Eemian'' period, between -120,000 and -115,000 BPE in the SeaRISE version of the GRIP temperature data.  We also see that the result \emph{does} depend on resolution.  Higher resolution grids allow the model to better resolve the flux through outlet glaciers especially, which are topographically-controlled, and such an effect explains the greater Eemian volume loss in the above 10\,km time series.  See the later examples in this manual for more on high resolution modeling.

\end{figure}




\subsection{More runs: grid sequencing}  \label{subsect:gridseq}  


\subsection{Going forward}  \label{subsect:forecastcaution}  Because real ice sheets, and ice sheet models too, have a ``memory'' of past climates, results of ``forecast'' runs may strongly depend on the nature of the spin-up process which create the initial conditions.  It is critical to evaluate the quality of the spunup state, for example using present-day observations of surface velocity and other fields \cite{AschwandenAdalgeirsdottirKhroulev}.  Critical thinking about a broad range of modeling hypotheses is prerequisite to building models of future behavior.


\subsection{Handling NetCDF files}\label{subsect:nctoolsintro}  PISM takes one or more NetCDF files as input, then it does some computation, and then it produces one or more NetCDF files as output.  Usually, other tools help to extract meaning from these NetCDF files, and yet more tools help with creating PISM input files or post-processing PISM output files.

Table \ref{tab:NetCDFview} lists such tools.  We frequently use \texttt{ncview}, ``\texttt{ncdump -h}'', and NCO for quick visualization, metadata examination, and command-line manipulation, respectively.  Visualization tools IDV and PyNGL are especially useful.  

To use CDO on PISM files, first run the script \texttt{nc2cdo.py}, from the \texttt{util/} PISM directory, on the file.  This fixes the metadata so that CDO will understand the mapping.

Regarding the creation of input files for PISM, see the section \ref{sec:bootstrapping-format} and table \ref{tab:modelhierarchy} for ideas about the data necessary for modeling.
