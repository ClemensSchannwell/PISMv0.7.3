\subsection{Controlling basal strength}  \label{subsect:basestrength}
\optsection{Basal strength and sliding}

When using option \texttt{-ssa_sliding}, the SIA+SSA hybrid model, a sub-model for basal resistance is required.  That is, a \emph{sliding law} must be chosen.  Table \ref{tab:basal-strength} describes the options that control how basal resistance is computed.

In PISM the strength value is always a basal yield stress $\tau_c$ (=\texttt{tauc} in PISM output files).  This parameter represents the strength of the aggregate material at the base of an ice sheet, a poorly-observed mixture of liquid water, ice, granular till, and bedrock bumps.  The yield stress concept also extends to the power law form, and thus most standard sliding laws can be chosen by user options (below).

One reason that the yield stress is a useful parameter is that it can be compared, when looking at PISM output files, to the driving stress.  Specifically, where \texttt{tauc} $<$ \texttt{taud_mag} you are likely to see sliding if option \texttt{ssa_sliding} is used.

The value of $\tau_c$ is determined in part by a subglacial hydrology model, including the modeled till-pore water pressure \texttt{tillwat} (subsection \ref{subsect:subhydro}).  The value of $\tau_c$ is also determined in part by a stored basal material property $\phi=$\texttt{tillphi}, the ``till friction angle'' \cite{Paterson}.  These quantities combine in the Mohr-Coulomb criterion \cite[Chapter 8]{Paterson} to determine the basal yield stress:
\begin{equation}
   \tau_c = c_{0} + (\tan\phi)\,N_{til}.  \label{eq:mohrcoulomb}
\end{equation}
Here $c_0$ is called the ``till cohesion'', whose default value in PISM is zero \cite[formula (2.4)]{SchoofStream}.

The effective pressure on the till $N_{til}$ is a modeled quantity determined by assuming a compressible saturated till.  In this compressible-till model the till effective pressure $N_{til}$ is a locally-computable function of the amount of water in the till $W_{til} =$ \texttt{tillwat} \cite{BuelervanPeltDRAFT}:
\begin{equation}
N_{til} = \delta P_o \, 10^{(e_0/C_c) \left(1 - (W_{til}/W_{til}^{max})\right)}  \label{eq:computeNtil}
\end{equation}
The following options control this local model:\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{-till_reference_void_ratio}$= e_0$, dimensionless, with default value 0.69 \cite{Tulaczyketal2000b},
\item \texttt{-till_compressibility_coefficient} $= C_c$, dimensionless, with default value 0.12 \cite{Tulaczyketal2000b},
\item \texttt{-till_effective_fraction_overburden}$= \delta$, dimensionless, with default value 0.01, and
\item \texttt{-hydrology_tillwat_max}$= W_{til}^{max}$, with units of meters and default value 2 meters.
\end{itemize}

Lower effective pressure means that more of the weight of the ice is carried by pressurized water and thus that the ice can slide more easily because the shear stress needed to slide is smaller.  The amount of water in the till is a nontrivial output of the hydrology and conservation-of-energy submodels in PISM.  The non-conserving hydrology model \texttt{-hydrology null} has been extensively used in modelling ice streaming \cite{BBssasliding,BKAJS,Winkelmannetal2011}, while many other possible combinations of basal strength models and hydrology models have not been extensively tested.

In any case the meaning of the yield stress is that the (vector) basal shear stress is at most the yield stress, and only once the shear stress reaches the yield value can there be sliding:
\begin{equation*}
   |\tau_b| \le \tau_c \quad \text{and} \quad \tau_b = \tau_c \frac{\mathbf{u}}{|\mathbf{u}|} \quad\text{if and only if}\quad |\mathbf{u}| > 0.
\end{equation*}

As noted, the yield stress $\tau_c$ can also be part of a power law model, a ``pseudo-plastic'' law.  Here stress is a power of basal sliding velocity $\mathbf{u}$, but in a form where the coefficient has units of stress:
\begin{equation}
\tau_b = \tau_c \frac{|\mathbf{u}|^{q-1}}{u_{\text{threshold}}^q}\, \mathbf{u}.
\label{eq:pseudopower}
\end{equation}
The plastic law is the case $q=0$.  Here $\tau_c$ corresponds to the variable \texttt{tauc} in PISM output files, $q$ is the power controlled by \texttt{-pseudo_plastic_q}, and the threshold velocity $u_{\text{threshold}}$ is controlled by \texttt{-pseudo_plastic_uthreshold}.

\begin{quote}
  \textbf{WARNING!} Options \texttt{-pseudo_plastic_q} and \texttt{-pseudo_plastic_uthreshold} have no effect if \texttt{-pseudo_plastic} is not set.
\end{quote}

The purely plastic case is the default; just use \texttt{-ssa_sliding} to turn it on.  Options \texttt{-yield_stress constant} and \texttt{-tauc} can be used to fix the yield stress in time and possibly space.  On the other hand the normal modeling case is where variations in yield stress, both in time and space, are part of the explanation of the locations of ice streams \cite{SchoofStream}.

Equation \eqref{eq:pseudopower} is a very flexible power law form.  For example, the linear case is $q=1$, in which case if $\beta=\tau_c/u_{\text{threshold}}$ then the law is of the form
    $$\tau_b = \beta \mathbf{u}$$
(The ``$\beta$'' coefficient is also called $\beta^2$ in some sources \cite[for example]{MacAyeal}.)  If you want such a linear sliding law, and you have a value $\beta=$\texttt{beta} in $\text{Pa}\,\text{s}\,\text{m}^{-1}$, then you can use this option combination:
\begin{verbatim}
-pseudo_plastic -pseudo_plastic_q 1.0 -pseudo_plastic_uthreshold 3.1556926e7 \
  -yield_stress constant -tauc beta
\end{verbatim}
\noindent (You are setting $u_{\text{threshold}}$ to 1 $\text{m}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ but using units $\text{m}\,\text{a}^{-1}$.)  More generally, it is common in the literature to see power-law sliding relations in the form
    $$\tau_b = C |\mathbf{u}|^{m-1} \mathbf{u},$$
as, for example, in section \ref{subsect:MISMIP}.  In that case, use this option combination:
\begin{verbatim}
-pseudo_plastic -pseudo_plastic_q m -pseudo_plastic_uthreshold 3.1556926e7 \
  -yield_stress constant -tauc C
\end{verbatim}

Recall the Mohr-Coulomb equation \eqref{eq:mohrcoulomb} which determines the yield stress $\tau_c$ from the till friction angle $\phi=$\texttt{tillphi} among other factors.  We find that an effective, though heuristic, way to determine \texttt{tillphi} is to make it a function of bed elevation \cite{Winkelmannetal2011}.  This heuristic is motivated by hypothesis that basal material with a marine history should be weak \cite{HuybrechtsdeWolde}.  PISM has a mechanism setting $\phi$=\texttt{tillphi} to be a \emph{piecewise-linear} function of bed elevation.  The option is
\begin{verbatim}
-topg_to_phi phimin,phimax,bmin,bmax
\end{verbatim}
Thus the user supplies 4 parameters: $\phi_{\mathrm{min}}$, $\phi_{\mathrm{max}}$, $b_{\mathrm{min}}$, $b_{\mathrm{max}}$, where $b$ stands for the bed elevation.  To explain these, we define the rate $M = (\phi_{\text{max}} - \phi_{\text{min}}) / (b_{\text{max}} - b_{\text{min}})$.  Then
\begin{equation}
  \phi(x,y) = \begin{cases}
    \phi_{\text{min}}, & b(x,y) \le b_{\text{min}}, \\
    \phi_{\text{min}} + (b(x,y) - b_{\text{min}}) \,M,
    &  b_{\text{min}} < b(x,y) < b_{\text{max}}, \\
    \phi_{\text{max}}, & b_{\text{max}} \le b(x,y). \end{cases}\label{eq:2}
\end{equation}

See the \emph{PISM Source Code browser}, source files in \texttt{src/base/basalstrength}, and \cite{BBssasliding,BKAJS,Martinetal2011,Winkelmannetal2011} for more details on how basal resistance is computed, and how it affects ice dynamics.

\begin{quote}
  It is worth noting that an earth deformation model (see section
  \ref{subsect:beddef}) changes $b(x,y)$ used in (\ref{eq:2}), so a sequence of
  runs such as
\begin{verbatim}
pismr -i foo.nc -bed_def lc -ssa_sliding -topg_to_phi 10,30,-50,0 ... -o bar.nc
pismr -i bar.nc -bed_def lc -ssa_sliding -topg_to_phi 10,30,-50,0 ... -o baz.nc
\end{verbatim}
  will use \emph{different} \texttt{tillphi} fields in the first and second
  runs. PISM will print a warning during initialization of the second run:
\begin{verbatim}
* Initializing the default basal yield stress model...
  option -topg_to_phi seen; creating tillphi map from bed elev ...
PISM WARNING: -topg_to_phi computation will override the 'tillphi' field
              present in the input file 'bar.nc'!
\end{verbatim}
  Omitting the \texttt{-topg_to_phi} option will make PISM continue the first
  run above with the same \texttt{tillphi} field.
\end{quote}

The major example of \texttt{-ssa_sliding} usage is in the first section of this manual.  A simpler artificial example, in which sliding happens in the ``trough'', is
\begin{verbatim}
pisms -eisII I -ssa_sliding -Mx 91 -My 91 -Mz 51 \
      -topg_to_phi 5.0,15.0,0.0,1000.0 -y 12000
\end{verbatim}

A final note on basal sliding is in order.  Sliding in the SIA stress balance model has been proposed, where the velocity of sliding is a local function of the driving stress at the base.  Such a SIA sliding mechanism appears in ISMIP-HEINO \cite{Calovetal2009HEINOfinal} and other places.  This kind of sliding is \emph{not} recommended, as it does not make sense to regard the driving stress as the local generator of flow if the bed is not holding all of that stress.  Within PISM, for historical reasons, there is an implementation of SIA-based sliding for verification test E; see \texttt{SIA_Sliding.cc}.  PISM does \emph{not} support this sliding mode in other contexts without modifications of the source code.


\subsection{Subglacial hydrology}  \label{subsect:subhydro}
\optsection{Subglacial hydrology}

At the present time, only simple subglacial hydrology models are implemented and documented in PISM.  At the most basic level, the energy conservation calculation generates basal melt.  According to the hydrology model, some of that water is stored locally in a layer of modeled till under the ice sheet.  That till is a key part of the model for sliding and ice streams \cite{Clarke05,SchoofTill,SchoofStream}.  In one documented model, water can be transported horizontally down the gradient of the modeled hydraulic potential.

Table \ref{tab:hydrology} documents subglacial hydrology model choices, and options for controlling them.

In the default model (\intextoption{hydrology} \texttt{null}) the water is \emph{not} conserved but it is stored locally in the till up to a specified amount \cite{BBssasliding}; option \intextoption{hydrology_tillwat_max} controls that amount.  The water is not conserved in the sense that water above the \texttt{tillwat_max} level is lost permanently.

In the other documented model (\texttt{-hydrology routing}) the water \emph{is} conserved in the map-plane.  Some water still gets put into the till, with the same maximum, but excess water is horizontally-transported.  It will flow in the direction of the negative of the gradient of the modeled hydraulic potential.  In the \texttt{routing} model the potential is calculated by assuming that the transportable subglacial water is at the overburden pressure \cite{Siegertetal2009}, an assumption which does not relate to the modeled effective pressure on the till.  Ultimately the transportable water will reach the ice sheet grounding line or ice-free-land margin, at which point it will be lost.  The amount that is lost this way is reported to the user.

In either model, a state (i.e.~input and output) variable \texttt{tillwat} is the effective thickness of the layer of liquid water in the till.  This layer of water relates to the basal boundary condition of the stress balance scheme, that is, it is used in computing the till yield stress $\tau_c$=\texttt{tauc}; see the previous subsection.  An additional state variable \texttt{bwat} is used by the \intextoption{hydrology} \texttt{routing} model.  It is the effective thickness of the layer of transportable water.

Several parameters are used in determining how water flows in the \texttt{routing} model.  Specifically, the horizontal subglacial water flux is determined by a generalized Darcy flux relation \cite{Clarke05,Schoofetal2012}
\begin{equation}  \label{eq:flux}
\bq = - k\, W^\alpha\, |\grad \psi|^{\beta-2} \grad \psi
\end{equation}
where $\bq$ is the lateral water flux, $W$(= bwat) is the effective thickness of the layer of transportable water, $\psi$ is the hydraulic potential, and $k$, $\alpha$, $\beta$ are controllable parameters (Table \ref{tab:hydrology}).  As noted, in the \texttt{routing} model the hydraulic potential is determined by the ice overburden pressure, so that $\psi = \rho_i g H + \rho_w g (b + W)$ where $g$ is gravity, $\rho_i$ is ice density, $\rho_w$ is fresh water density, $H$ is ice thickness, and $b$ is the local bedrock elevation.

For most choices of the relevant parameters and most grid spacings, the \texttt{routing} model is at least two orders of magnitude more expensive computationally than is the \texttt{null} model.  This follows directly from the CFL-type time-step restriction on lateral flow of a fluid with velocity on the order of centimeters to meters per second  (subglacial liquid water) compared to the much slower velocity of the flowing ice above.  Therefore the user should start with short runs of order a few model years, use option \intextoption{report_mass_accounting} to see the time-stepping behavior at \texttt{stdout}, and use \texttt{daily} or even \texttt{hourly} reporting for scalar and spatially-distributed time-series to see hydrology model behavior.

\subsection{Earth deformation models} \label{subsect:beddef} \index{earth deformation} \index{PISM!earth deformation models, using}
\optsection{Earth deformation models}

The option \txtopt{bed_def}{[none, iso, lc]} turns on bed deformation models.

The first model \texttt{-bed_def iso}, is instantaneous pointwise isostasy.  This model assumes that the bed at the starting time is in equilibrium with the load.  Then, as the ice geometry evolves, the bed elevation is equal to the starting bed elevation minus a multiple of the increase in ice thickness from the starting time: $b(t,x,y) = b(0,x,y) - f [H(t,x,y) - H(0,x,y)]$.  Here $f$ is the density of ice divided by the density of the mantle, so its value is determined by setting the values of \texttt{lithosphere_density} and \texttt{ice_density} in the configuration file; see subsection \ref{sec:pism-defaults}.  For an example and verification, see Test H in Verification section. 

The second model \texttt{-bed_def lc} is much more effective.  It is based on papers by Lingle and Clark \cite{LingleClark} and Bueler and others \cite{BLKfastearth}.  It generalizes and improves the most widely-used earth deformation model in ice sheet modeling, the flat earth Elastic Lithosphere Relaxing Asthenosphere (ELRA) model \cite{Greve2001}.  It imposes  essentially no computational burden because the Fast Fourier Transform is used to solve the linear differential equation \cite{BLKfastearth}.  When using this model in PISM, the rate of bed movement (uplift) is stored in the PISM output file and then is used to initialize the next part of the run.  In fact, if gridded ``observed'' uplift data is available, for instance from a combination of actual point observations and/or paleo ice load modeling, and if that uplift field is put in a NetCDF variable with standard name \texttt{tendency_of_bedrock_altitude} in the  \texttt{-boot_file} file, then this model will initialize so that it starts with the given uplift rate.

Minimal example runs to compare these models:
\begin{verbatim}
$ mpiexec -n 4 pisms -eisII A -y 8000 -o eisIIA_nobd.nc
$ mpiexec -n 4 pisms -eisII A -bed_def iso -y 8000 -o eisIIA_bdiso.nc
$ mpiexec -n 4 pisms -eisII A -bed_def lc -y 8000 -o eisIIA_bdlc.nc
\end{verbatim}
Compare the \texttt{topg}, \texttt{usurf}, and \texttt{dbdt} variables in the resulting output files.

Test H in section \ref{sec:verif} can be used to reproduce the comparison done in \cite{BLKfastearth}.


\subsection{Parameterization of bed roughness in the SIA} \label{subsect:bedsmooth} \index{Parameterization of bed roughness}
\optsection{Parameterization of bed roughness}

Schoof \cite{Schoofbasaltopg2003} describes how to alter the SIA stress balance to model ice flow over significant subglacial bedrock topgraphy.  One uses a smoothed (spatially-averaged) bed, but one also lowers the SIA diffusivity, in a precise way, related to how much the topography was smoothed-away.  As a practical matter for PISM, this theory improves the SIA's ability to handle bed roughness because it parameterizes the effects of "higher-order" stresses which act on the ice as it flows over bed topography.  There is also a mild performance boost because of the reduction of diffusivity.  For additional technical description of PISM's implementation, see the \emph{Browser} page ``Using Schoof's (2003) parameterized bed roughness technique in PISM''.

There is only one associated option: \intextoption{bed_smoother_range} gives the half-width of the square smoothing domain in meters.  If zero is given, \texttt{-bed_smoother_range 0} then the mechanism is turned off.  The mechanism is on by default using executable \texttt{pismr}, with the half-width set to 5 km (\texttt{-bed_smoother_range 5.0e3}), giving the recommended smoothing size of 10 km \cite{Schoofbasaltopg2003}.  This mechanism is turned off by default in executables \texttt{pisms} and \texttt{pismv}.

PISM writes fields \texttt{topgsmooth}, \texttt{schoofs_theta}, \texttt{thksmooth} from this mechanism.  (Regarding the last, the thickness is never actually smoothed.  However, the thickness relative to the smoothed bedrock elevation, i.e.~the difference between the unsmoothed surface elevation and the smoothed bedrock elevation, is used internally in the mechanism.)
