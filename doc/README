PISM is documented by three different structures (documents):
[AT LEAST THIS IS elb'S INTENT ON 8/12/07]

  1.  The 

                        PISM User's Manual

      It is file doc/manual.pdf.  It is generated by hand.  That is, 
      doc/manual.tex is a hand-written LaTeX source.  (Thus it can easily get out-of-date 
      relative to the source files for PISM.)  The sources for the User's Manual are
      doc/manual.tex, doc/ice_bib.bib, and the figure files in doc/figs.  

      The goal of the User's Manual is, naturally, to help people use PISM.  That is, to install
      it and control it.  A secondary goal is for users to understand what PISM is doing; this
      latter purpose is shallowly addressed in the User's Manual but deeply addressed in the 
      Reference Manual (next).
  
      ###  BUILD the User's Manual by "make" or "make manual.pdf" in doc/.
           View it with "evince doc/manual.pdf" or similar.                 ###
   
   
  2.  The 

                        PISM Reference Manual

      It is file doc/refman.pdf.  It is automatically generated
      by doxygen (www.doxygen.org or http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) using configuration file 
      doc/Doxyfile_tex.  The sources for the Reference Manual are all of the source files with root 
      src/ which contain doxygen-readable comments.  (These comments start with "//!" or "/*!".)
      
      The goal of the Reference Manual is, primarily, to have detailed TeXed descriptions of each 
      of the continuum models and their numerical implementations.  But the TeX for these detailed
      descriptions is in the doxygen-formated comments before the class declarations
      and class member implementations (i.e. procedures) in the various source files.  That is,
      look in the src/*/*.hh and src/*/*.cc files to find the sources of the Reference Manual.
      Thus the source files themselves could be the origin of the LaTeX which might go into
      an article on ice sheet modelling results from PISM.
      
      ### BUILD the Reference Manual by "make" or "make docs" in doc/.  
          View it with "evince doc/refman.pdf" or similar.         ###
  
  
  3.  The
  
                        PISM HTML Source Code Browser.
                        
      It is doc/html/index.html.  Like the Reference Manual it is automatically generated
      by doxygen, but it uses configuration file Doxyfile_html.  The sources for the Browser 
      are *all* source files in src/, regardless of whether doxygen-readable comments appear.
      This Source Code Browser is different from, and possibly inferior to, the source code 
      browser under Subversion at https://gna.org/projects/pism/.  The doxygen-erated Browser
      does document the C++ class structure thoroughly, and all source code dependencies.  And
      it took no effort to set up ...

      ### BUILD this HTML Source Code Browser by "make" or "make docs" in doc/ 
          View it by "firefox doc/html/index.html" or similar.       ###
