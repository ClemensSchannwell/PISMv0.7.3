PISM is documented by two PDF manuals for users.  For developers there is also
an HTML browser giving class structure and additional documentation of various 
kinds.

    
  PISM User's Manual (PDF)          [doc/manual.pdf]
  
      Build by "make" or "make userman" in doc/.  

      This manual is hand-generated; doc/manual.tex is the LaTeX source.
      Thus it can easily get out-of-date relative to the source files for PISM,
      but the goal is to keep it up to date.  Sources for the User's Manual are
      doc/manual.tex, doc/ice_bib.bib, and the figure files in doc/figs.  

      The goal of the User's Manual is, naturally, to help people use PISM.  
      That is, to use its existing abilities, those which don't require
      modifying the source code.  A secondary goal is for users to understand
      what PISM is doing, more seriously addressed in the developer
      documentation below.  A final goal is to specify those capabilities which
      the PISM developers will attempt to maintain in all future stable
      versions.  PISM features/capabilities which are not documented in the
      User's Manual should be presumed to be unstable (in the software sense!).


  PISM Installation Manual (PDF)    [doc/installation.pdf]
  
      Build by "make" or "make installation" in doc/.  

      This manual is hand-generated; doc/installation.tex is the LaTeX source.

  
  PISM Browser (HTML)               [doc/doxy/html/index.html]
                        
      Technical documentation.  Build by "make" or "make browser" or 
      "make browsenow" in doc/.  
      
      Automatically generated by doxygen.  See doxygen configuration file 
      doc/doxyfile_browser.  The sources for the Browser are *all* source files
      in src/, regardless of whether doxygen-readable comments appear.
