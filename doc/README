PISM is documented by two PDF manuals for users.  For developers there is also
an HTML browser of class structure and an additional PDF:

    
  PISM User's Manual (PDF)          [doc/manual.pdf]
  
      Build by "make" or "make userman" in doc/.  

      This manual is hand-generated; doc/manual.tex is the LaTeX source.
      Thus it can easily get out-of-date relative to the source files for PISM,
      but the goal is to keep it up to date.  Sources for the User's Manual are
      doc/manual.tex, doc/ice_bib.bib, and the figure files in doc/figs.  

      The goal of the User's Manual is, naturally, to help people use PISM.  
      That is, to use its existing abilities, those which don't require
      modifying the source code.  A secondary goal is for users to understand
      what PISM is doing, more seriously addressed in the developer
      documentation below.  A final goal is to specify those capabilities which
      the PISM developers will attempt to maintain in all future stable
      versions.  PISM features/capabilities which are not documented in the
      User's Manual should be presumed to be unstable (in the software sense!).


  PISM Installation Manual (PDF)    [doc/installation.pdf]
  
      Build by "make" or "make installation" in doc/.  

      This manual is hand-generated; doc/installation.tex is the LaTeX source.

  
  PISM C++ Class Browser (HTML)     [doc/doxy/html/index.html]
                        
      Developer document.  Build by "make" or "make browser" or 
      "make browsenow" in doc/.  
      
      Like the Reference Manual, this Browser is automatically generated
      by doxygen.  See doxygen configuration file doc/doxyfile_browser.  The 
      sources for the Browser are *all* source files in src/, regardless of 
      whether doxygen-readable comments appear.

      This C++ Class Browser is of course different from the repository browser 
      at https://gna.org/projects/pism/.  The gna.org browser keeps track of 
      source code changes through the Subversion revision control system.


  PISM Reference Manual  (PDF)      [doc/refman.pdf]

      Developer document.  Build by "make" or "make refman" in doc/.

      This manual is automatically generated by doxygen (www.doxygen.org or 
      http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/).  See doxygen configuration file 
      doc/doxyfile_refman.  The sources for the Reference Manual are all of the 
      source code files with root pism/src/ which contain doxygen-readable 
      comments; such comments start with "//!" or "/*!".

      The goal of the Reference Manual is, primarily, to have detailed LaTeXed 
      descriptions of each of the continuum models used in PISM, and their 
      numerical implementations.  The TeX for these detailed descriptions is 
      in the doxygen-readable comments in the source code.  That is, the TeX
      appears in the comments before the class declarations and class member 
      implementations (i.e. procedures) in the various source files src/*/*.hh
      and src/*/*.cc.  Thus the source files themselves could be, but cutting/
      pasting and modifying, the origin of LaTeXed equations in an article 
      on ice sheet modelling results from PISM.


Additional documents include a complete bibliography [doc/fullbib.pdf],
built by "make fullbib" in doc/.  One purpose of this trivial document 
is to display the full contents of the BibTeX input file  ice_bib.bib.  
Building it also generates fullbib.bbl, which is useful when grabbing 
bibliography items for the Reference Manual, for example.  There is also 
an "executive summary" [doc/pism_summary.pdf] of dubious utility; build
by "make summary" in doc/.
