PISM is documented by three PDF manuals and an HTML browser of class structure:

    
  1.      PISM User's Manual         [pism/doc/manual.pdf]
  
      BUILD the User's Manual by "make" or "make userman" in doc/.  View
      it with "acroread manual.pdf" or "evince manual.pdf" or similar.   

      This manual is hand-generated; doc/manual.tex is the LaTeX source.
      Thus it can easily get out-of-date relative to the source files for PISM,
      but the goal is to keep it up to date.  Sources for the User's Manual are
      doc/manual.tex, doc/ice_bib.bib, and the figure files in doc/figs.  

      The goal of the User's Manual is, naturally, to help people use PISM.  
      That is, to install PISM and use its existing abilities (i.e. those
      which don't require modifying the source code).  A secondary goal is 
      for users to understand what PISM is doing; this latter purpose is 
      shallowly-addressed in the User's Manual but deeply-addressed in the 
      Reference Manual (next).  A tertiary goal is to specify those 
      capabilities which the PISM developers will attempt to maintain in 
      all future stable versions; PISM features/capabilities which are not
      documented in the User's Manual should be presumed to be unstable 
      (in the software sense ;) ).


  2.      PISM Installation Manual         [pism/doc/installation.pdf]
  
      BUILD the User's Manual by "make" or "make installation" in doc/.  View
      it with "acroread installation.pdf" or "evince installation.pdf" or similar.   

      This manual is hand-generated; doc/installation.tex is the LaTeX source.
      Thus it can easily get out-of-date relative to the source files for PISM,
      but the goal is to keep it up to date.  

    
  3.      PISM Reference Manual      [pism/doc/refman.pdf]

      BUILD the Reference Manual by "make" or "make refman" in doc/.  View it 
      with "acroread refman.pdf" or "evince refman.pdf" or similar.

      This manual is automatically generated by doxygen (www.doxygen.org or 
      http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/).  See doxygen configuration file 
      doc/doxyfile_refman.  The sources for the Reference Manual are all of the 
      source code files with root pism/src/ which contain doxygen-readable 
      comments; such comments start with "//!" or "/*!".

      The goal of the Reference Manual is, primarily, to have detailed LaTeXed 
      descriptions of each of the continuum models used in PISM, and their 
      numerical implementations.  The TeX for these detailed descriptions is 
      in the doxygen-readable comments in the source code.  That is, the TeX
      appears in the comments before the class declarations and class member 
      implementations (i.e. procedures) in the various source files src/*/*.hh
      and src/*/*.cc.  Thus the source files themselves could be, but cutting/
      pasting and modifying, the origin of LaTeXed equations in an article 
      on ice sheet modelling results from PISM.
  
      
  4.      PISM C++ Class Browser (HTML)   [pism/doc/doxy/html/*]
                        
      BUILD this HTML Browser by "make" or "make browser" in doc/.  
      View it by "firefox doc/doxy/html/index.html" or similar.
      
      Like the Reference Manual, this Browser is automatically generated
      by doxygen.  See doxygen configuration file doc/doxyfile_browser.  The 
      sources for the Browser are *all* source files in src/, regardless of 
      whether doxygen-readable comments appear.

      This C++ Class Browser is different from the source code repository browser 
      at https://gna.org/projects/pism/.  The gna.org browser keeps track of 
      source code changes through the Subversion revision control system.


  Additional documents include a complete bibliography [pism/doc/fullbib.pdf].
  Build this by "make fullbib" in doc/.  One purpose of this trivial document 
  is to display the full contents of the BibTeX input file  ice_bib.bib.  
  Building it also generates fullbib.bbl, which is useful when grabbing 
  bibliography items for the Reference Manual, for example.




***********************

Bueler's cookbook for maintaining PISM:


1)  How do I make a .tar.gz from the current svn?

  I assume that pism-stable0.1/ contains the source to tar up.  Then:
   
   $ svn export pism-stable0.1/ pism-stable0.1.0           # TELL SVN TO MAKE A CLEAN COPY
   $ tar -cvzf pism-stable0.1.0.tar.gz pism-stable0.1.0/   # TAR IT UP
   $ tar -tvf pism-stable0.1.0.tar.gz                      # CHECK IT FOR CONTENTS
   $ gpg --detach pism-stable0.1.0.tar.gz                  # GENERATE .sig SIGNATURE FILE;
                                                           # passphrase in wallet
   $ scp pism-stable0.1.0.tar.gz pism-stable0.1.0.tar.gz.sig \
        bueler@download.gna.org:/upload/pism/              # UPLOAD


2)  Which files do I need to keep up-to-date at www.pism-docs.org for stable docs?

  These files:
   
   doc/
     refman.pdf
     manual.pdf
     installation.pdf


3)  How do I upload a recent version of the C++ class browser?

  Build it, tar it, send to dogbert, then get on dogbert and unzip it in the right place:
  
   $ cd doc && make browser
   $ tar -cvzf browser_recent.tar.gz doxy/html/
   $ scp browser_recent.tar.gz bueler@dogbert.gi.alaska.edu:~bueler/pismdocs/
   $ ssh -XY bueler@dogbert.gi.alaska.edu                   # ALIASED TO "dogbert"
   $ rm -rf doxy/                                           # CLEAR OUT OLD
   $ tar -xvf browser_recent.tar.gz                         # CREATES doxy/html/
   
  Now try "firefox www.pism-docs.org/doxy/html/index.html" on remote machine.  If
  success, log off of dogbert.
  
  Also consider doing

   $ scp refman.pdf bueler@dogbert.gi.alaska.edu:~bueler/pismdocs/refman-dev.pdf
