\section*{Introduction}

\large
This \emph{Installation Manual} describes how to download the PISM source code and install PISM and the libraries it needs.  Information about PISM, including a \emph{User's Manual}, is on-line at
\bigskip
\begin{center}
  \href{http://www.pism-docs.org}{www.pism-docs.org}
\end{center}
\bigskip
\noindent The fastest path to a fully functional PISM installation is to use a Linux system with a Debian-based package system (e.g.~Ubuntu) and then install Python packages following section \ref{sec:python}.  See subsection \ref{subsec:debian} about the Debian installation route.

\section{Libraries and programs needed by PISM}
\label{sec:prerequisites}

\bigskip
\normalspacing
This table lists required dependencies for PISM alphabetically.
\bigskip
\newcommand{\fattablespacing}{\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{1.5}\tiny\normalsize}

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{lll}
    \toprule
    \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Required Program or Library}} & \textbf{Comment}\\
    \midrule

\end{center}

\bigskip

Before installing these ``by hand'', check the Debian and Mac OS X sections below for specific how-to.  In particular, if multiple MPI implementations (e.g.~MPICH and Open-MPI) are installed then PETSc can under some situations ``get confused'' and throw MPI-related errors.  Even package systems have been known to allow this confusion.

Two libraries are needed for specific PISM features (earth deformation (``isostatic rebound'') 
model and computing corrected cell areas), and are thus only recommended: \bigskip

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{lll}
    \toprule
    \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Recommended Library}} & \textbf{Comment}\\

    PROJ.4 & \url{http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/} & \\
   \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\bigskip

In addition, Python (\url{http://python.org/}) is needed both in the PETSc installation process and in scripts related to PISM pre- and post-processing, while Git (\url{http://git-scm.com/}) is usually needed to download the PISM code.  Both should be included in any Linux/Unix distribution.  Additionally, the following Python packages are needed to do all the examples in the \emph{User's Manual} (which run python scripts).

\section{Installation Cookbook}\label{sec:cookbook}

\subsection{Installing PISM on a Debian-based Linux system} \label{subsec:debian}

\subsubsection{Installing PISM's prerequisites using a meta-package and building PISM from source}
\label{sec:deb-pism-toolkit}

If you are using a Debian-based system such as Ubuntu, you can download and
install the ``pism toolkit'' meta-package to make sure that all prerequisite
tools and libraries\footnote{Except PETSc.} are installed. (You still need to
build PISM from sources.)

To use this route of installing PISM's prerequisites, download
\texttt{pism-toolkit-FIXME.deb} from \url{http://www.pism-docs.org} and run
\begin{verbatim}
$ sudo dpkg -i pism-toolkit-FIXME.deb
$ sudo apt-get -f install
\end{verbatim}%$
or double-click on the file and click ``Install''. Once this is done, see
section \ref{sec:install-cmake} for configuration and compilation instructions.

\subsubsection{Installing PISM's prerequisites if a meta-package does not work}
\label{sec:deb-libraries-by-hand}

If you need to compile PISM from sources and you can not use the meta-package
described in the previous section, you can use your package manager to manually
select packages PISM requires.

Find and install (using \texttt{apt-get} or \texttt{synaptic}, for example) the following packages:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular*}{0.9\linewidth}{p{0.2\linewidth}p{0.7\linewidth}}
    \toprule
    \emph{Package name} & \emph{Comments}\\
    \midrule
    \texttt{libblas-dev} & required by PETSc\\
    \texttt{liblapack-dev} & required by PETSc \\
    \texttt{libopenmpi-dev} & required by PETSc and PISM \\
    \texttt{openmpi-bin} & required to run PISM in parallel \\
    \texttt{libgsl0-dev} & required by PISM\\
    \texttt{libfftw3-dev} & optional; used in the bed deformation code\\
    \texttt{libproj-dev} & optional; used to compute ice area and volume \\
    \texttt{netcdf-bin} & \texttt{ncgen} is used during the build process \\
    \texttt{libnetcdf-dev} & required by PISM \\
    \texttt{g++} & required to build PISM \\
    \texttt{git} & required to get PISM source code \\
    \texttt{cmake} & used to configure PISM \\
    \texttt{cmake-curses-gui} & a text-based GUI for CMake \\
    \texttt{python-dev} & (helps with scripts\dots perhaps not essential) \\
    \texttt{ncview} & \\
    \texttt{nco} & used in many pre-processing scripts \\
    \texttt{cdo} & used in some pre-processing scripts \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular*}
\end{center}

Packages \texttt{libopenmpi-dev} and \texttt{openmpi-bin} are not needed if you
will configure PETSc with \texttt{--download-mpich=1} or similar.

See section \ref{sec:install-cmake} for configuration and compilation
instructions and refer to the \emph{Getting Started} section of the
\emph{User's Manual} once you are done.

\vspace{0.3in}

\subsection{Generic PISM installation, using PETSc source code}\label{subsec:generic}

\subsubsection{Installing prerequisites}
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\textbf{\arabic{enumi}.}~}
\begin{enumerate}
\item You will need a UNIX system with Internet access. A GNU/Linux environment
  will be easiest but other UNIX versions have been used successfully. Package
  management systems are useful for installing many of the tools listed in
  section \ref{sec:prerequisites}, \emph{but} an up-to-date PETSc distribution
  may not be available in your system's package repositories. You will need
  \href{http://www.python.org/}{Python} and \href{http://git-scm.com/}{Git}
  installed, but these are included in all current Linux distributions. To use
  the (recommended) graphical output of PISM you will need an
  \href{http://www.x.org/}{X Windows server}.

\item As PISM is currently under rapid development, we distribute it only as
  compilable source code. On the other hand, there are several software
  libraries needed by PISM. Therefore the ``header files'' for these libraries
  are required for building PISM. In particular this means that the
  ``developer's versions'' of the libraries are needed if the libraries are
  downloaded from package repositories like Debian.

\item PISM uses \href{http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/}{NetCDF (=
    \emph{network Common Data Form})}\index{NetCDF} for an input and output
  file format. If it is not already present, install it using the instructions
  at the web-page or using a package management system.

\item PISM uses the \href{http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/}{GSL (= \emph{GNU
      Scientific Library})}\index{GSL (\emph{GNU Scientific Library})} for
  certain numerical calculations and special functions. If it is not already
  present, install it using the instructions at the web-page or using a package
  management system.

\item PISM optionally uses the \href{http://www.fftw.org/}{``FFTW'' library
    (FFTW = \emph{Fastest Fourier Transform in the West})}\index{FFTW
    (\emph{Fastest Fourier Transform in the West})} in one approximation of the
  deformation of the solid earth (bed) under ice loads.\footnote{Bueler and
    others (2007). \emph{Fast computation of a viscoelastic deformable Earth
      model for ice sheet simulation}, Ann.~Glaciol.~46, pp.~97–-105.} If you
  want the functionality of this bed deformation model, which is coupled to the
  ice flow and which we recommend, install FFTW or check that it is installed
  already. If this library is absent, all of PISM will work \emph{except} for
  this bed deformation model.

\item You will need a version of \href{http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/}{MPI (=
    \emph{Message Passing Interface})}.\index{MPI (\emph{Message Passing
      Interface})} Your system may have an existing MPI installation, in which
  case the path to the MPI directory will be used when installing PETSc below.
  Otherwise we recommend that you allow PETSc to download
  \href{http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich2/}{MPICH2} as part of the PETSc
  configure process (next). In either case, once MPI is installed, you will
  want to add the MPI \texttt{bin} directory to your path so that you can
  invoke MPI using the \texttt{mpiexec} or \texttt{mpirun} command. For
  example, you can add it with the statement

\texttt{export PATH=/home/user/mympi/bin:\$PATH}  \qquad (for \texttt{bash} shell)

\noindent or

\texttt{setenv PATH /home/user/mympi/bin:\$PATH}  \qquad (for \texttt{csh} or \texttt{tcsh} shell).

\noindent Such a statement can, of course, appear in your \texttt{.bashrc},
\texttt{.profile}, or \texttt{.cshrc} file so that there is no need to retype
it each time you use MPI.

\medskip
\begin{center}
  \emph{From now on this manual will assume the use of} bash.
\end{center}
\medskip

\item PISM uses \href{http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/}{PETSc (=
    \emph{Portable Extensible Toolkit for Scientific
      Computation})}.\index{PETSc (\emph{Portable Extensible Toolkit for
      Scientific computation})} Let's get this out of the way: note ``PETSc''
  is pronounced ``pet-see''. Download the PETSc source by grabbing the current
  gzipped tarball:
\begin{center}
    \url{http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/}
\end{center}
PISM requires a version of PETSc which is \texttt{\PETSCREL} or later. The
``lite'' form of PETSc is fine if you are willing to depend on an Internet
connection for accessing the PETSc documentation.

You should configure and build PETSc \emph{essentially} as described on the
PETSc installation page, but it might be best to read the following comments on
the PETSc configure and build process first:

\renewcommand{\labelenumii}{(\roman{enumii})}\begin{enumerate}
\item Untar in your preferred location, but note PETSc should \emph{not} be
  configured (next) using root privileges. Note that you will need to define
  the environment variable \texttt{PETSC_DIR}\index{PETSC_DIR} before
  configuring PETSc (next). For instance, once you have entered the PETSc
  directory just untarred, \texttt{export PETSC_DIR=\$PWD}. (Or
  \texttt{PETSC_DIR=`pwd`}. In this case, note the use of the backprime
  (\emph{accent-grave}) character, and not the single apostrophe \texttt{'}.)

\item When you run the configure script in the PETSc directory, the following
  options are recommended; note PISM uses shared libraries by
  default:\index{PETSC_ARCH}
\begin{verbatim}
$  export PETSC_DIR=$PWD
$  export PETSC_ARCH=linux-gnu-opt
$  ./config/configure.py --with-shared-libraries --with-debugging=0
\end{verbatim}

Turning off the inclusion of debugging code and symbols gives a significant speed improvement.

Using shared libraries may be unwise on certain clusters, etc.; check with your system administrator.

Note that there is no PISM use of Fortran, and that it is sometimes convenient to have PETSc grab a local copy of BLAS\index{BLAS (\emph{Basic Linear Algebra Subsystem})} and LAPACK\index{LAPACK (\emph{Linear Algebra PACKage})} rather than using the system-wide version.  So one may add ``\texttt{--with-fortran=0} \texttt{--download-c-blas-lapack=1}'' to the other configure options.

\item If there is an existing MPI\index{MPI (\emph{Message Passing Interface})} installation, for example at \texttt{/home/user/mympi/}, one can point PETSc to it by adding the option \texttt{--with-mpi-dir=/home/user/mympi/}.  The path used in this option must have MPI executables \texttt{mpicxx} and \texttt{mpicc}, and either \texttt{mpiexec} or \texttt{mpirun}, in sub-directory \texttt{bin/} and MPI library files in sub-directory \texttt{lib/}.

\item On the other hand, it seems common that one needs to tell PETSc to download MPI\index{MPI (\emph{Message Passing Interface})} into a place it understands, even if there is an existing MPI.  If you get messages suggesting that PETSc cannot configure using your existing MPI, you might try \texttt{configure.py} with option \texttt{--download-mpich=1}.

\item Configuration of PETSc for a batch system requires special procedures described at the PETSc documentation site.  One starts with a configure option \texttt{--with-batch=1}.  See the ``Installing on machine requiring cross compiler or a job scheduler'' section of the \href{http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-2/documentation/installation.html}{PETSc installation page}.

\item  Configuring PETSc takes many minutes even when everything goes smoothly.   A value for the environment variable \texttt{PETSC_ARCH} will be reported at the end of the configure process; take note of this value.  (Note that a previously installed PETSc can be reconfigured with a new \texttt{PETSC_ARCH} if necessary.)

\item  After \texttt{configure.py} finishes, you will need to \texttt{make all test} in the PETSc directory and watch the result.  If the X Windows system is functional some example viewers will appear; as noted you will need the X header files for this to work.

\item Finally, you will want to set the \texttt{PETSC_DIR} and the \texttt{PETSC_ARCH} environment variables in your \texttt{.profile} or \texttt{.bashrc} file.  Also remember to add the MPI \texttt{bin} directory to your \texttt{PATH}.  For instance, if you used the option \texttt{--download-mpich=1} in the PETSc configure, the MPI \texttt{bin} directory will have a path like \texttt{\$PETSC_DIR/\$PETSC_ARCH/bin}.  Therefore the lines 
\begin{verbatim}
export PETSC_DIR=/home/user/petsc-3.2-p7/
export PETSC_ARCH=linux-gnu-opt
export PATH=$PETSC_DIR/$PETSC_ARCH/bin/:$PATH
\end{verbatim}
\noindent could appear in one of those files.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\medskip See the table in the section \ref{sec:prerequisites} for a summary of the dependencies on external libraries, including
those mentioned so far.

\subsubsection{Installing PISM itself}
\label{sec:install-cmake}
At this point you have configured the environment which PISM needs.  You are ready to build PISM itself, which is a much quicker procedure!

\begin{enumerate}\setcounter{enumi}{7}
\item Get the latest source\index{PISM!download source code} for PISM using the Git\index{Git} version control system:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{getPISMstep} Check the website \url{http://www.pism-docs.org/} for the latest version of PISM.
\item Do
\begin{verbatim}
$  git clone git://github.com/pism/pism.git pism0.5
\end{verbatim}
\item A directory called ``\texttt{pism0.5/}'' will be created.  Note that in the future when you enter that directory,
  \texttt{git pull} will update to the latest revision of PISM.\footnote{Of course, after \texttt{git pull} you will \texttt{make -C
      build install} to recompile and re-install PISM.}
\end{enumerate}

\item Make sure that \texttt{PETSC_ARCH} and \texttt{PETSC_DIR} variables are set.

\item Build PISM:\footnote{Please report any problems you meet at this build stage by sending us the output: \href{mailto:help@pism-docs.org}{help@pism-docs.org}.}
\begin{verbatim}
$  mkdir pism0.5/build
$  cd pism0.5/build
$  PISM_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/pism cmake ..
$  make install
\end{verbatim}

You might need to add \texttt{CC} and \texttt{CXX} to the \texttt{cmake}
command:
\begin{verbatim}
$  PISM_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/pism CC=mpicc CXX=mpicxx cmake ..
\end{verbatim}
Whether this is necessary or not depends on your MPI setup.

This will configure PISM to be installed in \texttt{\textasciitilde/pism/bin},
\texttt{\textasciitilde/pism/lib/pism} and
\texttt{\textasciitilde/pism/share/doc}, then compile and install all its
executables and scripts.

If your operating system does not support shared libraries\footnote{This might be necessary if you're building on a Cray XT5 or a Sun Opteron Cluster, for example.}, then set \texttt{BUILD_SHARED_LIBS} to ``OFF''. This can be done by
either running
\begin{verbatim}
$  cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=OFF ..
\end{verbatim}%$
or by using \texttt{ccmake}:\footnote{Install the \texttt{cmake-curses-gui} package to get \texttt{ccmake} on Ubuntu.} run
\begin{verbatim}
$  ccmake ..
\end{verbatim}%$
and then change \texttt{BUILD_SHARED_LIBS} (press 'c' (configure), then 'g' (generate makefiles))
before \texttt{make install}.

You might also need to set \texttt{Pism_LINK_STATICALLY} on systems that do not
tolerate any compiler options related to shared libraries.

Object files created during the build process (located in the \texttt{build}
sub-directory) are not deleted after installing PISM, so do ``\texttt{make
  clean}'' to delete these if space is an issue. You can also delete the build
directory if you are not planning on re-compiling PISM.

\item PISM executables can be run most easily by adding the \texttt{bin/}
  sub-directory in your selected install path
  (\texttt{\textasciitilde/pism/bin} in the example above) to your
  \texttt{PATH}. For instance, this command can be done in the \texttt{bash}
  shell or in your \texttt{.bashrc} file:\index{setting the \$PATH to find PISM
    executables}
\begin{verbatim}
export PATH=~/pism/bin:$PATH
\end{verbatim}

\item See the \emph{Getting Started} section \emph{User's Manual} to continue.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Installing PISM on a Cray XT system}
\label{sec:cray}

Installing PISM on a Cray XT system deserves a special mention for two reasons:
\begin{itemize}
\item Cray XT does not support dynamic libraries
\item Cray XT uses non-standard locations for libraries and header files (which
  is never a good thing)
\end{itemize}

Here is a description of a successful PISM installation on a Cray XT at the
Danish Meteorological Institute.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Load appropriate modules. (You will need to set module versions; note
  that PISM requires PETSc 3.2.)
\begin{verbatim}
module swap PrgEnv-pgi PrgEnv-gnu

module swap xt-asyncpe xt-asyncpe{/x.y.z}
module swap gcc gcc{/x.y.z}
module swap xt-mpt xt-mpt{/x.y.z}
module swap xt-libsci xt-libsci{/x.y.z}

module load fftw{/x.y.z}
module load netcdf{/x.y.z}
module load petsc{/x.y.z}
\end{verbatim}
\item \href{http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl}{Download} and install GSL:
\begin{verbatim}
configure --prefix=/your/choice && make && make install
\end{verbatim}
  Make sure that GSL is compiled with GNU compilers, since it will be linked
  into PISM executables, which will be compiled with gnu compilers as well.
\item \href{http://www.cmake.org}{Download} and install CMake:
\begin{verbatim}
CC=/usr/bin/gcc CXX=/usr/bin/g++ configure --prefix=/your/choice
make && make install
\end{verbatim}
  The reason for specifying \texttt{CC=/usr/bin/gcc} and \texttt{CXX=/usr/bin/g++} in
  configuring CMake is to use the base compilers instead of the programming
  environment specific to Cray XT systems of the frontend nodes, since building
  pism is done on the frontend nodes.
\item Get PISM sources and create a build directory
\begin{verbatim}
git clone git://github.com/pism/pism.git
mkdir pism/build
cd pism/build
\end{verbatim}
\item Create a text file \texttt{pism_config.cmake} in the build directory you
  created. It should contain the following.
  (Replace \texttt{/some/path} with the GSL install location and
  \texttt{/your/choice} with the directory you want to install PISM in.)
\begin{verbatim}
set (CMAKE_C_COMPILER "cc" CACHE STRING "") 
set (CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER "CC" CACHE STRING "")
set (CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX "/your/choice" CACHE STRING "")

set (BUILD_SHARED_LIBS OFF CACHE BOOL "")
set (CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH ON CACHE BOOL "")
set (Pism_ADD_FPIC OFF CACHE BOOL "")
set (Pism_LINK_STATICALLY ON CACHE BOOL "")

set (PETSC_EXECUTABLE_RUNS YES CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
set (PETSC_FOUND YES CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
set (PETSC_INCLUDES "/" CACHE STRING "" FORCE)
set (PETSC_LIBRARIES "/" CACHE STRING "" FORCE)

set (GSL_INCLUDES "/some/path/include" CACHE STRING "")
set (GSL_LIB "/some/path/lib/libgsl.a;/some/path/lib/libgslcblas.a" CACHE STRING "")

set (NETCDF_INCLUDES "/" CACHE STRING "")
set (NETCDF_LIBRARIES "/" CACHE STRING "")

set (FFTW_INCLUDES "/" CACHE STRING "")
set (FFTW_LIBRARIES "/" CACHE STRING "")

set (MPI_INCLUDE_PATH "/" CACHE STRING "")
set (MPI_LIBRARY "/" CACHE STRING "")
set (MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY "/" CACHE STRING "")
\end{verbatim}
\item Configure and build PISM:
\begin{verbatim}
cmake -C pism_config.cmake ..
cmake ..
make install
\end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}

CMake's configuration mechanism cannot locate libraries and headers
automatically because Cray doesn't follow industry conventions, so we provide a
CMake script (above) which provides bogus locations, fooling CMake.

Loading all the necessary modules allows compilers to find headers and
libraries even though the resulting CMake configuration is invalid.

\subsection{Installing PISM on Mac OS X}  \label{subsec:macosx}

Please refer to section \ref{subsec:generic} for the description of PISM's use of prerequisites and generic installation
instructions. This section describes an adaptation of the same process to the Mac OS X operating system.

\begin{enumerate}
\item As PISM is distributed as compilable source code only, you will need
  software developer's tools, XCode and the \emph{X window system}, X11. Both
  packages can be installed by either downloading them from
  \href{http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/}{Apple Developer Connection} or
  using the Mac OS X installation DVD.
\item The use of \href{http://www.macports.org/}{MacPorts} or
  \href{http://www.finkproject.org/}{Fink} is recommended, as it significantly
  simplifies installing many open-source libraries. Download a package from the
  \href{http://www.macports.org/install.php}{MacPorts homepage} (or
  (\href{http://www.finkproject.org/download/index.php}{Fink homepage}, install
  and set the environment:

\begin{verbatim}
export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH
\end{verbatim}
for MacPorts and
\begin{verbatim}
source /sw/bin/init.sh
\end{verbatim}
for Fink.

\item Note that it is not necessary to install Python, as it is bundled with
  the operating system (as are BLAS and LAPACK).

  Some PISM scripts use SciPy. It is possible to install it using MacPorts;
  using \href{http://www.enthought.com/}{Enthought Python Distributions} is
  another option.

\item  If you're using MacPorts, do
\begin{verbatim}
$  sudo port install netcdf ncview gsl fftw-3 libproj4 git-core cmake
\end{verbatim}%$
to install NetCDF, ncview, GSL, FFTW, PROJ.4, Git, and CMake.

If you're using Fink, use the following command instead (\texttt{ncview} is only available in the unstable branch).
\begin{verbatim}
$  fink install netcdf gsl fftw3 proj git cmake
\end{verbatim}

\item At this point, all the PISM prerequisites except PETSc are installed. Download the latest PETSc tarball from the
  \href{http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-as/}{PETSc website}. Untar, then change to the directory just created.
The next three commands completed the PETSc installation:
\begin{verbatim}
$  export PETSC_DIR=$PWD; export PETSC_ARCH=macosx;
$  ./config/configure.py --download-mpich=1 --with-shared-libraries \
                         --with-debugging=no --with-fortran=0
$  make all test
\end{verbatim}

We are telling PETSc to download and build MPICH-2, because recent Mac OS X
versions do not include Open MPI. (This works better than trying to install
Open MPI or MPICH-2 via MacPorts.)

\item Finally, to build PISM, see section \ref{sec:install-cmake}.

\item See the \emph{Getting Started} section \emph{User's Manual} to continue.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{If it still does not work}
\label{subsec:config}

We recommend using \texttt{ccmake}, the text-based CMake interface to adjust
PISM's build parameters. One can also set CMake cache variables using the
\texttt{-D} command-line option (\texttt{cmake -Dvariable=value}) or by editing
\texttt{CMakeCache.txt} in the build directory.

Here are some issues we know about.
\begin{itemize}
\item Sometimes it is necessary to set \texttt{GSL_CBLAS_LIB} using
  \texttt{cmake -Dvariable=value} mechanism if installation fails at the
  linking stage.
\item Sometimes, if a system has more than one MPI installation CMake finds the
  wrong one. To tell it which one to use, set \texttt{MPI_LIBRARY} and related
  variables by using \texttt{ccmake} or editing \texttt{CMakeCache.txt} in the
  build directory. You can also set environment variables \texttt{CC} and
  \texttt{CXX} to point to MPI wrappers:
\begin{verbatim}
$  CC=mpicc CXX=mpicxx cmake path/to/pism-source
\end{verbatim}

  It is also possible to guide CMake's configuration mechanism by setting
  \texttt{MPI_COMPILER} to the compiler (such as \texttt{mpicc}) corresponding
  to the MPI installation you want to use, setting \texttt{MPI_LIBRARY} to
  \texttt{MPI_LIBRARY-NOTFOUND} and re-running CMake.
\item If you are compiling PISM on a system using a cross-compiler, you will
  need to disable CMake's tests trying to determine if PETSc is installed
  properly. To do this, set \texttt{PETSC_EXECUTABLE_RUNS} to ``yes''.

  To tell CMake where to look for libraries for the target system, see
  \url{http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Cross_Compiling} and the paragraph about
  \texttt{CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH} in particular.
\item Some systems support static libraries only. To build PISM statically and
  tell CMake not to try to link to shared libraries, set
  \texttt{BUILD_SHARED_LIBS} to \texttt{OFF} and \texttt{Pism_LINK_STATICALLY}
  to \texttt{ON} using \texttt{ccmake}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Quick tests of the installation}
Once you're done with the installation, a few tests can confirm that PISM is functioning correctly.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Try a MPI four process verification run:

\begin{verbatim}
$ mpiexec -n 4 pismv -test G -y 200
\end{verbatim}

  \noindent If you see some output and a final \texttt{Writing model state}
  \texttt{to file 'verify.nc'} \texttt{... done} then PISM completed
  successfully. At the end of this run you get measurements of the difference
  between the numerical result and the exact solution. See the \emph{User's
    Manual} for more on PISM verification.

  The above ``\texttt{-n 4}'' run should work even if there is only one actual
  processor (core) on your machine, in which case MPI will just run multiple
  processes on the one processor. This run will also produce a NetCDF output
  file \texttt{verify.nc}, which can be read and viewed by NetCDF tools.

\item Try an EISMINT II run using the PETSc viewers (under the X window system):

\begin{verbatim}
$ pisms -y 5000 -view_map thk,temppabase,csurf
\end{verbatim}

  \noindent When using such viewers and \texttt{mpiexec} the additional final
  option \texttt{-display :0} \,is sometimes required to enable MPI to use X,
  like this:

\begin{verbatim}
$ mpiexec -n 2 pisms -y 5000 -view_map thk,temppabase,csurf -display :0
\end{verbatim}

\item Run a basic suite of software tests: \footnote{Note that these tests use
    NCO and depend on Python packages \texttt{numpy} and
    \texttt{netcdf4-python}}
\begin{verbatim}
$ make test
\end{verbatim}

  (You need to be in PISM's build directory.)

  \noindent Feel free to email us about failed tests, etc.:
  \href{mailto:help@pism-docs.org}{help@pism-docs.org}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Next steps}

Start with the \emph{User's Manual}, which has a ``Getting started'' section. A
copy is on-line at the PISM homepage and documentation page
\href{http://www.pism-docs.org/}{\texttt{www.pism-docs.org}}, along with a
source code \emph{Browser} (HTML). Completely up-to-date documentation can be
built from \LaTeX~source in the \texttt{doc/} sub-directory, as described in
the last section.

A final reminder with respect to installation: Let's assume you have checked
out a copy of PISM using Git, as in step \ref{getPISMstep} above. You can
update your copy of PISM to the latest version by running \texttt{git pull} in
the PISM directory and \texttt{make install} in your build directory.


\section{Installing Python packages}
\label{sec:python}

If you're lucky, you might be able to install all the Python packages mentioned
in section \ref{sec:prerequisites} using a package manager. On the other hand,
the Python packages below are not currently available in Debian package
repositories. They are easy to install using Python \texttt{setuptools},
however; these tools are included with recent versions of Python. And you might
not be using a package manager!

\subsubsection*{Python module \texttt{netCDF4}, from package
  \texttt{netcdf4-python}}

You can skip this paragraph if you have
\href{http://www.enthought.com/}{Enthought Python Distributions} installed.

If you have NetCDF 3.6.2, you will need to download version 0.9.3 of
\texttt{netcdf4-python} (later versions do not have the \texttt{netCDF3}
module). Recent versions require HDF5 and NetCDF-4.

To install \texttt{netcdf4-python} providing the \texttt{netCDF4} module needed
by PISM scripts, download a tarball from the project homepage
\url{http://code.google.com/p/netcdf4-python/}.

\begin{verbatim}
$  wget http://netcdf4-python.googlecode.com/files/netCDF4-NUMBER.tar.gz
$  tar -xvf netCDF4-NUMBER.tar.gz
\end{verbatim}
Enter the directory you just untarred and install:
\begin{verbatim}
$  cd netCDF4-NUMBER/
$  sudo python setup.py install
\end{verbatim}
assuming that NetCDF was installed in the \texttt{/usr/} tree.

The scripts in directories \texttt{util/}, \texttt{examples/...}, and so on,
which need \texttt{netCDF4}, should now work.

\section{Rebuilding PISM documentation}
\label{sec:docs}

You might want to rebuild the documentation from source, as PISM and its
documentation evolve together. These tools are required: \bigskip
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular*}{0.9\linewidth}{llp{0.55\linewidth}}
    \toprule
    \LaTeX & \href{http://www.latex-project.org/}{\texttt{www.latex-project.org}} &  needed for rebuilding any of the documentation \\
    \texttt{doxygen}\index{doxygen} & \href{http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/}{\texttt{www.doxygen.org}} &  for rebuilding the \emph{Browser} from source  \\
    \texttt{graphviz}\index{graphviz} & \href{http://www.graphviz.org/}{\texttt{www.graphviz.org}} &  used in diagrams in the \emph{Browser}  \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular*}
\end{center}
\bigskip
\noindent To rebuild PISM documentation, change to the PISM build directory and do
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{p{0.22\linewidth}p{0.75\linewidth}}
    \texttt{make manual} & to build the \emph{User's Manual}, \texttt{manual.pdf}\\
    \texttt{make forcing} & to build the \emph{PISM's Climate Forcing
      Components} document, \texttt{forcing.pdf} \\
    \texttt{make installation} & to build this document, the \emph{Installation Manual}, \texttt{installation.pdf}\\
    \texttt{make browser_base} & to build the \emph{PISM Source Code Browser},\\
    \texttt{make browser_util} & to build the \emph{PISM Utility Class Browser},\\
    \texttt{make cheatsheet} & to build the 2-page PISM Cheat-Sheet summarizing its command-line options\\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\end{document}
