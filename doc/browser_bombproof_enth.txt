/*! \page bombproofenth BOMBPROOF, a numerical scheme for conservation of energy

\section intro Introduction

One of the essential goals for any thermomechanically-coupled numerical ice sheet model is a completely bombproof numerical scheme for the advection-conduction-reaction problem for the conservation of energy within the ice and the bedrock.  The conservation of energy problem here is described in terms of the enthalpy field for the ice and in terms of temperature for the bedrock.

"Bombproof" means being, roughly, as stable as possible in as many realistic modeling contexts as possible.  PISM's scheme is observed to be highly robust in practice, but it is also provably stable in a significant range of circumstances.  The scheme is special to shallow ice sheets because it makes specific tradeoff choices with respect to vertical velocity, though it is generic (and low order) with respect to horizontal velocity.  In this page we will state the scheme, prove its stability properties, and specify the nontrivial modifications needed at the ice-bedrock transition.

Accuracy is necessarily a second goal.  It is partly achieved 
here because our scheme has truncation error \f$O(\Delta z^2)\f$
in many circumstances, though it reverts to lower order when it "detects trouble"
in the form of large vertical velocities.  More completely stated, the scheme has 
order \f$O(\Delta t,\Delta x,\Delta y, \Delta z^2)\f$ in circumstances where the vertical
ice flow velocity is small enough, relative to conductivity, and otherwise reverts to 
order \f$O(\Delta t,\Delta x,\Delta y, \Delta z^1)\f$.

The finite difference scheme in this section supercedes the PISM scheme for the 
temperature equation described in the appendices of [\ref BBL].  That scheme 
is robust but it has a CFL condition on \e vertical advection, an avoidable time step 
restriction.  The CFL condition on \e horizontal advection
remains in the new scheme, however.  The scheme here is conditionally stable 
as an adaptive time-stepping technique for the 3D conservation of energy equation.
The length of the time step is limited only by the maximum magnitude of the 
horizontal velocities within the ice.

The ice %region in which the energy equation needs to be solved, at least within 
the ice sheet and attached ice shelves, generally changes over time.  This is an 
essential complicating factor in ice sheet modeling.  According to user options, 
there may also be a model for the energy within a layer of bedrock 
below the ice sheet.  The implementation must accommodate these possibilities.
Equally essential is the fact that the velocity field has a
complicated provenance.  It comes from a variety of stress
balance equations.  These stress balances, especially where there is a transition 
in flow type, for instance at grounding lines, are incompletely understood
when thermomechanically coupled.  The stress balance could be the SIA, the
SSA, a mix of these in different parts of the ice sheet/shelf system, or
other stress balances in future PISM versions.

We need to \e not make, and we will not make in proving stability, assumptions
about the regularity of the velocity field in space or time.  Beyond boundedness,
that is.  Nor do we want the numerical scheme for advection to need any
information about the velocity except its value at the beginning of the time
step.  Thus we would not accept a scheme which required the Jacobian
of the velocity field with respect to changes in energy, for example.
At very least we cannot implement a fully-implicit scheme without some 
blind iteration (%e.g. with no guarantee of convergence of the iteration).
The scheme we propose involves no such iteration.


\section iceequations Conservation of energy in a shallow ice sheet

In terms of the ice specific enthalpy field \f$E(x,y,z,t)\f$, which has units of 
\f$\text{J}\,\text{kg}^{-1}\f$ in SI, the energy equation is [\ref AschwandenBlatter]
\anchor basicEnergy
  \f[ \rho \frac{dE}{dt} = -\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} + Q,\tag{basicEnergy} \f]
where \f$\rho\f$ is the material density.  The units of equation
(\ref basicEnergy), and of the quantity \f$Q\f$ described below, are
\f$J\,\text{s}^{-1}\,\text{m}^{-3}\f$ in SI.

The heat flux in cold ice and temperate ice is
\anchor heatflux
  \f[ \mathbf{q} = \begin{cases}
                      - k_i c_i^{-1} \nabla E, & \text{cold ice}, \\
                      0, & \text{temperate ice}, \tag{heatflux} \\
                   \end{cases} \f]
where \f$k_i,c_i\f$ are constant.  (In fact we will consider nonzero flux in the temperate ice case, either conceptualized as a regularization of the "real" equation, or as a flux of latent heat carried by liquid water.)  Note \f$dE/dt\f$ stands for the material derivative of the enthalpy field, so the expanded form of (\ref basicEnergy) is
  \f[ \rho \left(\frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + \mathbf{U}\cdot \nabla E\right)
        = -\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} + Q, \f]
where \f$\mathbf{U}\f$ is the three dimensional velocity.  Thus three-dimensional advection is included.

The additive quantity \f$Q\f$ is the dissipation (strain-rate) heating.  Without making any shallow approximations, the exact formula for this is
  \f[ Q = \sum_{i,j=1}^3 D_{ij} \tau_{ij} \f] 
where \f$D_{ij}\f$ is the strain rate tensor and \f$\tau_{ij}\f$ is the deviatoric stress tensor.  References [\ref BBL, \ref BBssasliding] address how this term is computed in PISM, according to the shallow stress balance approximations.
(Within the source code, see methods IceModel::velocitySIAStaggered() and
IceModel::correctSigma().  Note \f$Q\f$ was called \f$\Sigma\f$ in the just-mentioned references.)

In a sliding model with an ice-bedrock interface, the friction of the sliding also is a source of heating.  It has units of W m-2 = J s-1 m-2, that is, heating per area.  In formulas we write
  \f[ F_b = - \tau_b \cdot \mathbf{u}_b, \f]
where \f$\tau_b\f$ is the basal shear stress and \f$\mathbf{u}_b\f$ is the basal sliding velocity.  The friction heating is concentrated at \f$z=0\f$.  Note that the basal shear stress is oppositely-directed to the basal velocity.  (For example, in the plastic case \f$\tau_b = - \tau_c \mathbf{u}_b / |\mathbf{u}_b|\f$ where \f$\tau_c\f$ is a positive scalar, the yield stress.)  The term \f$F_b\f$ will enter into the basal boundary condition, the flux jump condition addressed in section \ref melt below.

We use a shallow approximation of equation (\ref basicEnergy).  It lacks horizontal
conduction terms  [\ref Fowler].  For the initial analysis of the core BOMBPROOF
scheme, we specialize to cold ice and we do not consider the bedrock thermal layer,
which is returned to later (below).  Therefore, within cold ice, the coefficient in the heat
flux is constant, so
  \f[ \nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} = - k_i c_i^{-1} \frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial z^2}. \f]
Therefore the equation we initially analyze is

\anchor basicShallow
\f[
\rho_i \left(\frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + \mathbf{U}\cdot \nabla E\right) = k_i c_i^{-1} \frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial z^2} + Q,\tag{basicShallow}
\f]

We will assume, of course, that \f$\rho_i\f$ and \f$c_i\f$ are positive.

We will be focusing on the direction in which the enthalpy and temperature has largest spatial gradient, 
namely with respect to the vertical coordinate \f$z\f$.  Rewriting equation (\ref basicShallow)
to emphasize the vertical terms we have

\anchor vertProblem
\f{align*}
\rho_i \left(\frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + w \frac{\partial E}{\partial z}\right) 
     &= k_i c_i^{-1}  \frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial z^2} + \Phi \tag{vertProblem}
 \f}
where
\f[
\Phi = Q - \rho_i \left(u \frac{\partial E}{\partial x}
                         + v \frac{\partial E}{\partial y}\right)
\f]

The boundary conditions to problem (\ref vertProblem) are a surface temperature
condition at the top of the ice and a geothermal flux condition at the bottom of the ice.
(Only at the end will we consider the bedrock thermal layer.)  Within cold ice
the enthalpy and the temperature are linearly related,
  \f[ T(E,p) = c_i^{-1} (E-E_s(p)) + T_m(p) = c_i^{-1} E, \f]
because the enthalpy is normalized by \f$E_s(p) = c_i T_m(p)\f$.  (See documentation
on the EnthalpyConverter class.)  We will assume that in reasonably-realistic
ice sheet modeling situations the surface temperature \f$T_s(t,x,y)\f$ (K) and
the geothermal flux \f$G(t,x,y)\f$ (W m-2) are given.  Thus for cold ice, and no
bedrock thermal layer,

\anchor columnbcs
\f[
E(t,z=H) = c_i T_s, \qquad -k_i c_i^{-1} \frac{\partial E}{\partial z}\Big|_{z=0} = G.\tag{columnbcs}
\f]


\section corebombproof The core BOMBPROOF scheme

For the discussion of the numerical scheme below, let \f$E_{ijk}^n\f$ be our approximation to 
the exact enthalpy \f$E\f$ at the grid point with coordinates \f$(x_i,y_j,z_k)\f$ at 
time \f$t_n\f$.  When \f$i,j\f$ are uninteresting we will suppress them and write \f$E_k^n\f$.  
We will use similar notation for numerical approximations to the other quantities, like
velocity components \f$u,v,w\f$ and \f$\Phi\f$.  We put the horizontal advection terms in 
the source term \f$\Phi\f$ because we treat it explicitly, evaluating at time \f$t_n\f$.
(Implicit or semi-implicit treatment of horizontal advection would
require a coupled system distributed across processors.  That kind of numerical difficulty
can be avoided, even given the other constraints on accuracy and implementation.)

The scheme we use for horizontal advection is explicit first-order upwinding.  There is a CFL condition for the scheme to be stable, in the absence of conduction, and it is based on the magnitude of the horizontal velocity components.  To state the upwind scheme itself, let
  \f[\Up{f_{\bullet}}{\alpha_i} = \begin{cases}
                                     f_i-f_{i-1}, & \alpha_i\ge 0, \\
                                     f_{i+1}-f_i, & \alpha_i<0.
                                  \end{cases}\f]
The approximate horizontal advection terms, and thus the approximation to the whole
term \f$\Phi\f$, are
	\f[\Phi_{ijk}^n = \Sigma_{ijk}^n - \rho_i 
	                   \left( u_{ijk}^n\,\frac{\Up{E_{\bullet jk}^n}{u_{ijk}^n}}{\Delta x}
	                          + v_{ijk}^n\,\frac{\Up{E_{i\bullet k}^n}{v_{ijk}^n}}{\Delta y} \right).\f]

The CFL stability condition for this part of the scheme is
\anchor CFL
\f[
    \Delta t \,\left( \left|\frac{u_{ijk}^n}{\Delta x}\right|
                           + \left|\frac{v_{ijk}^n}{\Delta y}\right| \right) \le 1.\tag{CFL}
\f]
The routine IceModel::computeMax3DVelocities() computes the 
maximum of velocity magnitudes.  This produces a time step restriction based on 
the above CFL condition.  Then IceModel::determineTimeStep() 
implements adaptive time-stepping based on this and other stability criteria.

In the analysis below we will assume an equally-spaced grid \f$z_0,\dots,z_{M_z}\f$
with \f$\Delta z = z_{k+1} - z_k\f$.  In fact PISM has a remapping scheme in each 
column, wherein the enthalpy in a column of ice is stored on an unequally-spaced 
vertical grid, but is mapped to a fine, equally-spaced grid for the conservation
of energy computation described here.  (Similar structure applies to the age
computation.  See procedures IceEnthalpyModel::enthalpyAndDrainageStep() and
IceModel::ageStep(), and see the IceModelVec3 class and
IceGrid::get_fine_vertical_grid().  Options -z_spacing and -zb_spacing allow
choosing unequally-spaced storage vertical grids in ice and bedrock,
respectively.)

The \f$z\f$ derivative terms in (\ref vertProblem) will be approximated implicitly.  Let \f$\lambda\f$ be in the interval \f$0 \le \lambda \le 1\f$.  Suppressing indices \f$i,j\f$, the approximation to (\ref vertProblem) is
\anchor bombone
\f{align*}
\rho_i &\left( 
       \frac{E_k^{n+1} - E_k^n}{\Delta t}
       + \lambda w_k^n \frac{E_{k+1}^{n+1} - E_{k-1}^{n+1}}{2 \Delta z}
       + (1-\lambda) w_k^{n} \frac{\Up{E_{\bullet}^{n+1}}{w_k^{n}}}{\Delta z} \right) \\
     &= k_i c_i^{-1}\, \frac{E_{k+1}^{n+1} - 2 E_{k}^{n+1} + E_{k-1}^{n+1}}{\Delta z^2} + \Phi_k^n. \tag{bombone}
\f}

Equation (\ref bombone), along with a determination of \f$\lambda\f$ by (\ref lambdachoice) below, is the scheme BOMBPROOF.  It includes two approximations of vertical advection, combined with nonnegative coefficients which sum to one.  Both approximations are (semi-)implicit, but the centered formula has higher accuracy,
	\f[w_k^n \frac{E_{k+1}^{n+1} - E_{k-1}^{n+1}}{2 \Delta z}
	   = w \frac{\partial E}{\partial z} + O(\Delta t,\Delta z^2),\f]
while the first order upwind formula has lower accuracy,
	\f[w_k^{n} \frac{\Up{E_{\bullet}^{n+1}}{w_k^{n}}}{\Delta z}
	   = w \frac{\partial E}{\partial z} + O(\Delta t,\Delta z).\f]
We prefer for accuracy reasons to use the centered formula when possible, because it has higher order truncation error.  We only include (implicit) upwinding when it is needed for its added stability benefits.

Let
	\f[ \nu = \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta z},
	 \qquad \text{and} \qquad R = \frac{k_i \Delta t}{\rho_i c_i \Delta z^2}.\f]
We now rewrite (\ref bombone) for computational purposes as one of a system of equations 
for the unknowns \f$\{E_k^{n+1}\}\f$.  In the new system the coefficients will be
scaled so that the diagonal entries of the matrix have limit one as
\f$\Delta t\to 0\f$.  That is, we multiply equation (\ref bombone) by
\f$\Delta t\f$, divide it by \f$\rho_i\f$, and rearrange:
\anchor bombtwo
\f{align*}
&\left(-R - \nu w_k^n \uppair{1-\lambda/2}{\lambda/2}\right) E_{k-1}^{n+1}  
   + \left(1 + 2 R + \nu w_k^n (1-\lambda) \uppair{+1}{-1}\right) E_k^{n+1} \tag{bombtwo} \\
&\qquad\qquad + \left(-R + \nu w_k^n \uppair{\lambda/2}{1-\lambda/2} \right) E_{k+1}^{n+1}
    = E_k^n + \Delta t \rho_i^{-1}\Phi_k^n 
\f}
Here \f$\uppair{a}{b} = a\f$ when \f$w_k^n\ge 0\f$ and \f$\uppair{a}{b} = b\f$ when \f$w_k^n < 0\f$.

Either of equivalent Equations (\ref bombone) or (\ref bombtwo) combines two unconditionally 
stable ways of approximating vertical advection, namely implicit centered difference 
(\f$\lambda = 1\f$) and implicit first-order upwinding (\f$\lambda=0\f$).  The combination 
is "convex" because the coefficients are nonnegative and sum to one.

Regarding scaling of the equations and units, Equation (\ref bombtwo)
has coefficients which are scaled to have no units.  Equation (\ref bombtwo) is 
ready to be put in the system managed by an enthSystemCtx instance.

The pure implicit centered difference scheme (\f$\lambda=1\f$), namely
\anchor centered
\f{align*}
&\left(-R - \nu w_k^n/2\right) E_{k-1}^{n+1} + \left(1 + 2 R\right) E_k^{n+1} \tag{centered} \\
&\qquad\qquad + \left(-R + \nu w_k^n/2\right) E_{k+1}^{n+1} 
              = E_k^n + \Delta t \rho_i^{-1}\Phi_k^n 
\f}
is <i>less stable</i> than implicit first-order upwinding.  It is less stable 
in the same sense that Crank-Nicolson is a less stable scheme than 
backwards Euler for the simplest heat equation \f$u_t = u_{xx}\f$ [\ref MortonMayers].
In fact, although oscillatory modes cannot grow exponentially under equation (\ref centered),
those modes <i>can</i> appear when none are present already, even in the homogeneous case
\f$\Phi_k^n=0\f$.

One way of stating the greater stability of first-order upwinding is to say it satisfies a 
"maximum principle" [\ref MortonMayers].  An example of a maximum principle for this kind of finite difference 
scheme is that if \f$U_{k-1}^n,U_k^n,U_{k+1}^n\f$ are adjacent gridded values of some
abstract quantity at time step \f$t_n\f$, and if the next value satisfies the scheme
	\f[U_k^{n+1} = C_{-1} U_{k-1}^n + C_0 U_k^n + C_{+1} U_{k+1}^n\f]
for <i>nonnegative</i> coefficients \f$C_i\f$ summing to one, \f$C_{-1} + C_0 + C_{+1} = 1\f$, 
then it follows by the triangle inequality that
	\f[\min\{|U_{k-1}^n|, |U_k^n|, |U_{k+1}^n|\} 
	       \le |U_k^{n+1}| \le \max\{|U_{k-1}^n|, |U_k^n|, |U_{k+1}^n|\}.\f]
Thus a "wiggle" cannot appear in the abstract explicit scheme for \f$\{U_k^n\}\f$.
The proof below shows the corresponding "wiggle-free" property for scheme (\ref bombtwo).


\section theory Stability properties of the BOMBPROOF scheme

We want to be precise about the phrase "unconditionally stable" for BOMBPROOF.
To do so we consider somewhat simplified cases which are amenable to analysis, and
we prove two stability properties.  These stability properties identify the
precise advantages of BOMBPROOF.

\subsection stabilitythm Theorem (stating the stability properties).
Assume, for the precise but limited assertion of this theorem,
that the surface temperature \f$T_s\f$ and the geothermal flux \f$G\f$ are constant 
in time.  Assume also that the entire source function \f$\Phi\f$ is identically zero 
(but see comments below).  Fix an equally-spaced vertical grid \f$z_0=0 < z_1 < \dots < z_N=H\f$,
so that the upper grid point coincides with the surface of the ice.  With these assumptions, if
\anchor lambdachoice
\f[
\lambda = \min\left\{1, \quad 
	               \min_{k=0,\dots,N}\left\{\frac{2 k_i}{|w_k^n| \rho_i c_i \Delta z}\right\}
	               \quad \right\},\tag{lambdachoice}
\f]
reset at each time step \f$n\f$, then scheme (\ref bombone, \ref bombtwo) is
unconditionally-stable in the following two senses:

<ol>

<li>  A maximum principle applies without further assumptions.</li>
 
<li>  Suppose we freeze the coefficients of the problem to have constant values in
time and space.  (Concretely, we assume that \f$\lambda\f$ is chosen independently
of the time step \f$n\f$, and that \f$\Delta t\f$ is the same for each time step.
We assume constant vertical velocity \f$w_k^n=w_0\f$.  We also consider a spatially-periodic
or unbounded version of our problem, with no boundary conditions.)
Then a von Neumann  analysis of the constant coefficient problem yields 
a growth factor less than one for all modes on the grid.
</li>
</ol>

\subsection remark Remarks.
The phrases <i>maximum principle</i> and <i>von Neumann analysis</i>
will be precisely illustrated in the following proof.  Both approaches are in 
[\ref MortonMayers].  There is additional information on the 
von Neumann analysis of implicit methods for advection in [\ref Strikwerda].

These statements also apply in case \f$k_i=0\f$, in which case (\ref lambdachoice) implies
\f$\lambda=0\f$, and the method reduces to implicit first-order upwinding.  (Implicit
first-order upwinding has properties 1 and 2 [\ref Strikwerda].)  The case \f$k_i=0\f$
is relevant because it applies to temperate ice in which there is no enthalpy conduction.
One reasonable model for temperate ice is to assume no transport of the liquid fraction,
whether diffusive transport or otherwise, and to ignor conduction along the temperature
gradient, because the gradient is only from pressure-melting temperature differences.

\subsection proofone Proof of 1.

In the case considered for the maximum principle, with \f$\Phi_k^n=0\f$, 
we can rewrite (\ref bombtwo) as
\anchor formax
\f{align*}
&\left(1 + 2 R + \nu w_k^n (1-\lambda) \uppair{+1}{-1}\right) E_k^{n+1} \\
&\qquad = E_k^n + \left(R + \nu w_k^n \uppair{1-\lambda/2}{\lambda/2}\right) E_{k-1}^{n+1}
                + \left(R - \nu w_k^n \uppair{\lambda/2}{1-\lambda/2}\right) E_{k+1}^{n+1}.
                \tag{formax}
\f}

We claim that with choice (\ref lambdachoice) for \f$0 \le \lambda \le 1\f$, all 
coefficients in (\ref formax) are nonnegative.  At one extreme, in 
the upwinding case (\f$\lambda=0\f$), all the coefficients are nonnegative.  Otherwise, note that
\f$\nu w_k^n (1-\lambda) \uppair{+1}{-1}\f$ is nonnegative for any valid value 
of \f$\lambda\f$ and for any value of \f$w_k^n\f$, noting the meaning of the \f$\uppair{+1}{-1}\f$
symbol.  Thus the coefficient on the left is always nonnegative.  The coefficient of 
\f$E_{k-1}^{n+1}\f$ is clearly nonnegative for any valid value of \f$\lambda\f$ if \f$w_k^n \ge 0\f$.
The coefficient of \f$E_{k+1}^{n+1}\f$ is clearly nonnegative for any valid value of \f$\lambda\f$ if 
\f$w_k^n \le 0\f$.

Therefore the only concerns are for the coefficient of \f$E_{k-1}^{n+1}\f$ when \f$w_k^n\le 0\f$ and the 
coefficient of \f$E_{k+1}^{n+1}\f$ when \f$w_k^n\ge 0\f$.  But if \f$\lambda\f$ is smaller than 
\f$2k_i/(|w_k^n| \rho_i c_i \Delta z)\f$ then 
\f{align*}
R - \nu |w_k^n| (\lambda/2) &= \frac{k_i \Delta t}{\rho_i c_i \Delta z^2}
	                                       - \frac{\Delta t |w_k^n|}{\Delta z} \frac{\lambda}{2}
	        &\ge \frac{k_i \Delta t}{\rho_i c_i \Delta z^2}
	            - \frac{\Delta t |w_k^n|}{\Delta z} \frac{k_i}{|w_k^n| \rho_i c_i \Delta z} = 0.
\f}

Thus all the coefficients in (\ref formformax) are nonnegative, and a maximum principle applies. 
<b> END OF PROOF OF 1. </b> 

\subsection prooftwo Proof of 2.
As a von Neumann analysis is much more restrictive than the analysis above, we will be brief.  
Let's assume the velocity is downward, \f$w_0<0\f$; the other case is similar.  Equation
(\ref bombtwo) becomes 
\anchor prevon
\f{align*}
&\left(-R - \nu w_0 (\lambda/2)\right) E_{k-1}^{n+1}  
   + \left(1 + 2 R - \nu w_0 (1-\lambda)\right) E_k^{n+1} \\
&\qquad\qquad + \left(-R + \nu w_0 (1-\lambda/2) \right) E_{k+1}^{n+1}  = E_k^n.\tag{prevonN}
\f}

The heart of the von Neumann analysis is the substitution of a growing or decaying
(in time index \f$n\f$) oscillatory mode on the grid of spatial wave number \f$\mu\f$:
	\f[E_k^n = \sigma^n e^{i\mu\,(k\Delta z)}.\f]
Here \f$k\Delta z = z_k\f$ is a grid point.  Such a mode is a solution to (\ref prevon) 
if and only if
\f{align*}
\sigma\Big[  &(-R - \nu w_0(\lambda/2)) e^{-i\mu\Delta z}
	              + (1 + 2 R - \nu w_0 (1-\lambda)) \\
	           &\quad   + (-R  + \nu w_0 (\lambda/2)) e^{+i\mu\Delta z}
	                    + \nu w_0 (1-\lambda) e^{+i\mu\Delta z} \Big] = 1.
\f}
This equation reduces by standard manipulations to
	\f[\sigma = \frac{1}{1 + \left(4 R - 2 \nu w_0 (1-\lambda)\right)\cos^2(\mu \Delta z/2)
	                      + i\,\nu w_0 (1-\lambda/2)\sin(\mu\Delta z)}.\f]
Note \f$4 R - 2 \nu w_0 (1-\lambda) \ge 0\f$ without restrictions on 
numerical parameters \f$\Delta t\f$, \f$\Delta z\f$, because \f$w_0<0\f$ in the 
case under consideration.  Therefore
	\f[|\sigma|^2 = \frac{1}{\left[1 + \left(4 R - 2 \nu w_0 (1-\lambda)\right)
	                              \cos^2(\mu \Delta z/2)\right]^2
	                      + \left[\nu w_0 (1-\lambda/2)\sin(\mu\Delta z)\right]^2}.\f]
This positive number is less than one, so \f$|\sigma| < 1\f$.  It follows that all
modes decay exponentially.  <b> END OF PROOF OF 2. </b>


\subsection remarktwo Remark about our von Neumann stability analysis.

The constant \f$\lambda\f$ is carefully chosen in (\ref lambdachoice) so that the 
maximum principle <i>(I)</i> applies.  On the other hand, both the 
implicit first-order upwind and the implicit centered difference formulas have
unconditional stability in the von Neumann sense.  The proof of case
<i>(II)</i> above is thus a formality, merely showing that a
convex combination of unconditionally stable (von Neumann sense) schemes is still
unconditionally stable in the same sense.


\subsection maxconsequence Convergence: a consequence of the maximum principle.
 
If we define the pointwise numerical error \f$e_k^n = E_k^n - E(t_n,x_i,y_j,z_k)\f$,
where \f$E(\dots)\f$ is the unknown exact solution (exact enthalpy field) [\ref MortonMayers],
then (\ref formax) implies an equality of the form
	\f[A e_k^{n+1} = e_k^n + B_- e_{k-1}^{n+1} + B_+ e_{k+1}^{n+1} + \Delta t\, \tau_k^n\f]
where \f$\tau_k^n\f$ is the truncation error of the scheme and \f$A,B_\pm\f$ are nonnegative 
coefficients (which need no detail for now).  Note that
	\f[B_- + B_+ = 2 R + \nu w_k^n (1-\lambda) \uppair{+1}{-1}.\f]

Letting \f${\bar e}^n = \max_k |e_k^n|\f$ we have, because of the positivity of coefficients,
\anchor prebound
\f{align*}
&\left(1 + 2 R + \nu w_k^n (1-\lambda) \uppair{+1}{-1}\right)|e_k^{n+1}|  \\
& \qquad\qquad \le {\bar e}^n + \left(2 R + \nu w_k^n (1-\lambda) \uppair{+1}{-1}\right){\bar e}^{n+1}
     + \Delta t\,\bar\tau^n \tag{prebound}
\f}
for all \f$k\f$, where \f$\bar\tau^n = \max_k |\tau_k^n|\f$.  Now let \f$k\f$ be the index for 
which \f$|e_k^{n+1}| = {\bar e}^{n+1}\f$.  For that \f$k\f$ we can replace \f$|e_k^{n+1}|\f$ in 
equation (\ref prebound) with \f${\bar e}^{n+1}\f$.  Subtracting the same quantity from 
each side of the resulting inequality gives
\f[
{\bar e}^{n+1} \le {\bar e}^n + \Delta t\,\bar\tau^n,
\f]
It follows that \f$\bar e^n \le C \Delta t\f$, fo some finite \f$C\f$ if \f$\bar e^0\f$
[\ref MortonMayers].  Thus a maximum principle for BOMBPROOF implies convergence 
in the standard way [\ref MortonMayers].  This convergence proof has the same
assumptions as case 1 in the theorem, and thus it only \e suggests convergence
in any broad range of glaciologically-interesting cases.


\subsection final Final remark: nonzero source term.

Now recall we assumed in Theorem 1 that the entire "source" \f$\Phi_k^n\f$ was identically zero.
Of course this is not realistic.  What we understand is provable, however, is that if a
numerical scheme for a linear advection/conduction equation
	\f[u_t + A u_x = B u_{xx}\f]
is stable in the general sense of numerical schemes for partial differential equations
(%e.g. as defined in subsection 5.5 of [\ref MortonMayers]) then the same scheme is stable 
in the same general sense when applied to the equation with (linear) lower order terms:
	\f[u_t + A u_x = B u_{xx} + C u + D.\f]
A precise statement of this general fact is hard to find in the literature, 
to put it mildly, but theorem 2.2.3 of [\ref Strikwerda] is one interesting case
(\f$B=0\f$ and \f$D=0\f$).  But even the form we state with linear term (\f$C u + D\f$)
is not adequate to the job because of the strongly-nonlinear dependence of \f$\Phi\f$
on the temperature \f$T\f$ [\ref BBL].

Nonetheless the maximum principle is a highly-desirable
form of stability because we can exclude "wiggles" from the finite difference approximations
of the conductive and advective terms, even if the complete physics, with strain heating in particular,
is not yet shown to be non-explosive [\ref BBL].  Recall that, because we use first-order upwinding
on the horizontal advection terms, we can expect maximum principle-type stability behavior of the 
whole scheme.


\section bedrock A finite difference scheme for the bedrock thermal layer

Realistic ice sheet modeling requires the recognition that, because sensible heat flux is proportional
to temperature differences, the time-dependent geothermal contribution to the energy in the ice sheet
is related to the temperature in the ice itself.  This is a feedback mechanism that can,
and should, for completeness, be modeled  [\ref RitzFabreLetreguilly].

For instance, suppose the ice sheet is in a state in which the geothermal flux deep in the
crust is equal to the heat flux into the ice base.  If the ice cools from this state then, 
because the temperature gradient is now greater in magnitude, between the warm bedrock 
and the cooler ice, the ice will for some period receive more than the deep geothermal 
flux rate. Similarly, if the ice warms from the equal state then the temperature difference
with the bedrock has become smaller and the magnitude of the ice basal heat flux
will be less than the deep geothermal rate.

Because the relevant layer of bedrock below an ice sheet is again very shallow, and
because we can neglect all crustal flow, modeling the 
energy content, in our case the enthalpy \f$E(t,x,y,z)\f$, is quite simple.
The equation has only vertical conduction:
  \f[ \rho_b \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} = k_b c_b^{-1}  \frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial z^2}. \f]
Here we assume \f$\rho_b,k_b,c_b\f$ are constant material properties.  Note
that EnthalpyConverter includes a choice for converting between enthalpy
and temperature in bedrock: \f$E=E(T,p),\quad T=T(E,p)\f$.  For now the method
choosen is uninteresting.

Because there is no advection, our scheme is easily "bombproof" without choosing 
\f$\lambda\f$, or other complications.  In particular we use the simplest centered 
implicit (backward Euler) scheme and quickly get this scaled form,
\anchor bedrockeqn
\f[ -R_b E_{k-1}^{n+1} + \left(1 + 2 R_b\right) E_k^{n+1} - R_b E_{k+1}^{n+1}
         = E_k^n, \tag{bedrockeqn} \f]
where 
  \f[ R_b = \frac{k_b \Delta t}{\rho_b c_b \Delta z^2}. \f]
This is unconditionally stable (for a pure bedrock problem), and has a maximum
principle, without any further qualification [\ref MortonMayers].
Equation (\ref bedrockeqn) is ready to be put in the system managed by an enthSystemCtx instance.

When there is a bedrock layer of positive thickness, IceGrid::Mbz > 1.  We do
not allow IceGrid::Mbz==2 because we need to separate, by more than just one grid
interval, the ice/base transition location from the location of the application
of the geothermal flux.

The geothermal flux is applied at the bottom of the bedrock, which is where
\c k=0 in enthSystemCtx::solveThisColumn().  See the second of equations
(\ref columnbcs).  At this location we have the following equation, which
modifies the above generic bedrock segment case.  It replaces the flux through the lower
surface of the bottom segment of the column by a known flux:
\anchor geothermalbedeqn
\f[ \left(1 + 2 R_b\right) E_0^{n+1} - 2.0 R_b E_{+1}^{n+1}
         = E_k^n + \frac{2 \Delta t}{\rho_b \Delta z} G. \tag{geothermalbedeqn} \f]
The argument for this equation is standard, involving the introduction
of a virtual value \f$E_{-1}^{n+1}\f$ [\ref MortonMayers].


\section melt Heat flux jump condition at base, and melt rate

At the bottom of grounded ice, a certain amount of heat comes out of the earth
and enters the ice, \e or melts the base of the ice.  Furthermore, at the
contact of the ice and underlying material, heat is generated if there is
sliding.  Because the PISM user may or may not want a bedrock thermal layer,
and because the basal ice may be cold (below the pressure-melting temperature)
or temperate, there are a number of cases to consider and then correctly
approximate by finite difference schemes.

Equations (5.40) and (9.134) of \ref GreveBlatter2009 say the same thing about the jump of heat flux in both the cold and temperate cases, however:

\anchor meltheuristic
\f{equation*}
\left(\text{conductive heat flux from bedrock}\right) - \left(\text{conductive heat flux into the base of the ice}\right) = \left(\text{heat lost to melt rate}\right) - \left(\text{heat gained from friction}\right)
\f}

In particular, if there is zero basal melt rate and no sliding then the heat flux is a continuous vector quantity across the ice/bedrock interface.

For the translation of the last equation into symbols, let \f$M\f$ be the basal melt rate, positive when ice is being turned into liquid, and \f$L\f$ be the latent heat of fusion of water.  We use a small-slope assumption for the base, namely that the normal direction to the ice base is in the \f$z\f$ direction.  Recall from an earlier equation that \f$F_b = - \tau_b \cdot \mathbf{u}_b\f$ is the heating rate from friction.  Then at least the right hand side can be written down for all grounded cases:

\anchor melteqn
\f{align*}
\left(\text{conductive heat flux from bedrock}\right) - \left(\text{conductive heat flux into the base of the ice}\right) &= \rho_i L M +\tau_b \cdot \mathbf{u}_b
\f}

Of course \f$M=0\f$ and zero sliding are each allowed.  Furthemore, though we think of the frictional heat from sliding as being fully determined before doing one time step for conservation of energy, the melt rate is \e not known until the conservation of energy equation is solved.  That is, the melt rate \f$M\f$ is an unknown in the conservation of energy equation, to be solved-for here.
