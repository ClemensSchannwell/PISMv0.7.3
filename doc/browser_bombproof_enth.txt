\section intro Introduction: The need for a \e very stable scheme, even if not very accurate

One of the essential goals for any thermomechanically-coupled numerical ice sheet model 
is a completely bombproof numerical 
scheme for the advection-conduction-reaction problem for the conservation of
energy within the ice and the bedrock.  The conservation of energy problem here
is described in terms of the enthalpy field.  A similar, but strictly simpler, 
problem describes the evolution of the age field.
  
"Bombproof" means being, roughly, as stable as possible in as many realistic modeling
contexts as possible.  PISM illustrates this idea by including a scheme which is 
observed to be highly robust in practice.  The scheme is special to shallow ice sheets
because it makes specific tradeoff choices with respect to vertical velocity, but
it is generic and low order with respect to horizontal velocity.

In this section we prove stability properties of the scheme. 

Accuracy is also a goal, but it is necessarily a second goal.  It is partly achieved 
here because our scheme has truncation error \f$O(\Delta z^2)\f$
in many circumstances, though it reverts to lower order when it "detects trouble"
in the form of large vertical velocities.  More completely stated, the scheme has 
order \f$O(\Delta t,\Delta x,\Delta y, \Delta z^2)\f$ in circumstances where the vertical
ice flow velocity is small enough, relative to conductivity.

The finite difference scheme in this section supercedes the PISM scheme for the 
temperature equation described in the appendices of [\ref BBL].  That scheme 
is robust but it has a CFL condition on vertical advection, an avoidable time step 
restriction as a practical matter (because the scheme described here has been 
implemented successfully!).  The CFL condition on horizontal advection
remains in the new scheme, however.  The scheme here is conditionally stable 
as an adaptive time-stepping technique for the 3D conservation of energy equation.
The length of the time step is limited only by the maximum magnitude of the 
horizontal velocities within the ice.

The ice %region in which the energy equation needs to be solved, namely within 
the ice sheet and attached ice shelves, generally changes over time.  This is an 
essential complicating factor in ice sheet modeling.  According to user options, 
there may also be a model for the energy within a layer of bedrock 
below the ice sheet.  The implementation must include this possibility; it is
only addressed at the end.

Equally essential is the fact that the velocity field has a
complicated provenance.  It comes from a variety of stress
balance equations.  These stress balances, especially where there is a transition 
in stress balance type, like at grounding lines, are incompletely understood.
The stress balance could be the SIA, the SSA, a mix of these in different parts of the
ice sheet/shelf system, or a less shallow model in future PISM versions.

We will not make, and we need to not make, assumptions
about the regularity of the velocity field in space or time.  Nor do we want 
the numerical scheme for advection to need any information about the velocity
except its value at the beginning of the time step.  Thus we would not 
accept a scheme which required the Jacobian
of the velocity field with respect to changes in energy, for example.
At very least we cannot implement a fully implicit scheme without some 
blind iteration (%e.g. with no guarantee of convergence of the iteration), while 
the scheme we propose involves no iteration.


\section iceequations Equations for conservation of energy in ice

In terms of the specific enthalpy field \f$E(x,y,z,t)\f$, which has units of 
\f$J\,\text{kg}^{-1}\f$ in SI, the energy equation is [\ref AschwandenBlatter2009]

\anchor basicEnergy
  \f[ \rho \frac{dE}{dt} = -\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} + Q,\tag{basicEnergy} \f]
The heat flux in cold ice, temperate ice, and in bedrock is
\anchor heatflux
  \f[ \mathbf{q} = \begin{cases}
                      - k_i c_i^{-1} \nabla E, & \text{cold ice}, \\
                      0, & \text{temperate ice}, \tag{heatflux} \\
                      - k_b c_b^{-1} \nabla E, & \text{bedrock}, \\
                   \end{cases} \f]
where \f$k_i,c_i,k_b,c_b\f$ are all constant.  Note \f$dE/dt\f$ stands for the material
derivative of the enthalpy field,
  \f[ \frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + \mathbf{U}\cdot \nabla E, \f] 
so advection \e is present.  For historical reasons, and consistency 
with [\ref BBL], we denote the bulk strain 
heating term \f$Q\f$ in (\ref basicEnergy) as \f$\Sigma\f$.  The units of equation
(\ref basicEnergy), and of the quantity \f$Q=\Sigma\f$, are \f$J\,\text{s}^{-1}\,\text{m}^{-3}\f$
in SI.

As suggested by the calculation at the bottom of this page, the shallow approximation 
of this equation lacks horizontal conduction terms  [see also \ref Fowler].
Also, for the analysis of the core BOMBPROOF scheme, we specialize the analysis to cold ice.
Within the cold ice the coefficient in the heat flux is constant, so
  \f[ \nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} = - k_i c_i^{-1} \frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial z^2}. \f]
Therefore the equation we analyze is

\anchor basicShallow
\f[
\rho_i \frac{dE}{dt} = k_i c_i^{-1} \frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial z^2} + \Sigma,\tag{basicShallow}
\f]

We will assume, without exception, that \f$\rho_i,c_i,k_i\f$ are positive.
The details of how \f$\Sigma\f$ is calculated does not affect the derivation
here, and will not be given, but that term is naturally
described as a (self-)reaction term [\ref Fowler].

We will be focusing on the dimension in which the enthalpy and temperature has largest spatial gradient, 
namely with respect to the vertical coordinate \f$z\f$.  Rewriting equation (\ref basicShallow)
to emphasize the vertical terms we have

\anchor vertProblem
\f{align*}
\rho_i \left(\frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + w \frac{\partial E}{\partial z}\right) 
     &= k_i c_i^{-1}  \frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial z^2} + \Phi \tag{vertProblem}
 \f}
where
\f[
\Phi = \Sigma - \rho_i \left(u \frac{\partial E}{\partial x}
                         + v \frac{\partial E}{\partial y}\right)
\f]

The boundary conditions to problem (\ref vertProblem) are a surface temperature
condition at the top of the ice and a geothermal flux condition at the bottom of the ice.
(Until the end we shall assume that there is no bedrock thermal layer.)  Within cold ice
the enthalpy and the temperature are linearly related,
  \f[ T(H,p) = c_i^{-1} (E-E_s(p)) + T_m(p) = c_i^{-1} E, \f]
because the enthalpy is normalized by \f$E_s(p) = c_i T_m(p)\f$.  (See documentation
on the EnthalpyConverter class.)  We will assume that in reasonably realistic ice sheet modeling
situations the surface temperature \f$T_s(t,x,y)\f$ (K) and the geothermal flux
\f$G(t,x,y)\f$ (W m-2) are given.  Thus for cold ice surface and base, and no bedrock
thermal layer,

\anchor vPbcs
\f[
E(t,z=H) = c_i T_s, \qquad -k_i c_i^{-1} \frac{\partial E}{\partial z}\Big|_{z=0} = G.\tag{vPbcs}
\f]


\section The BOMBPROOF scheme itself

For the discussion of the numerical scheme below, let \f$E_{ijk}^n\f$ be our approximation to 
the exact enthalpy \f$E\f$ at the grid point with coordinates \f$(x_i,y_j,z_k)\f$ at 
time \f$t_n\f$.  When \f$i,j\f$ are uninteresting we will suppress them and write \f$E_k^n\f$.  
We will use similar notation for numerical approximations to the other quantities, like
velocity components \f$u,v,w\f$ and \f$\Phi\f$.  We put the horizontal advection terms in 
the source term \f$\Phi\f$ because (semi-)implicit treatment of horizontal advection would
require a coupled system distributed across processors.  That kind of numerical difficulty
can be avoided, even given the other constraints on accuracy and implementation.

The scheme we use for horizontal advection is explicit first-order upwinding.  
There is a CFL condition for the scheme to be stable, 
based on the magnitude of the horizontal velocity components, namely (\ref CFL) below.

To state the upwind scheme itself, let
  \f[\Up{f_{\bullet}}{\alpha_i} = \begin{cases}
                                     f_i-f_{i-1}, & \alpha_i\ge 0, \\
                                     f_{i+1}-f_i, & \alpha_i<0.
                                  \end{cases}\f]
(This is a slightly different definition of \f$\Up{f_{\bullet}}{\alpha_i}\f$
from that used in the appendices of [\ref BBL], though with exactly the same intent.)
The approximate horizontal advection terms, and thus the approximation to the whole
term \f$\Phi\f$, is stated using this upwind notation as
	\f[\Phi_{ijk}^n = \Sigma_{ijk}^n - \rho_i 
	                   \left( u_{ijk}^n\,\frac{\Up{E_{\bullet jk}^n}{u_{ijk}^n}}{\Delta x}
	                          + v_{ijk}^n\,\frac{\Up{E_{i\bullet k}^n}{v_{ijk}^n}}{\Delta y} \right).\f]
This is a completely explicit approximation of \f$\Phi\f$ at time \f$t_n\f$, the beginning 
of the time step.

The CFL stability condition for this part of the scheme is
\anchor CFL
\f[
    \Delta t \,\left( \left|\frac{u_{ijk}^n}{\Delta x}\right|
                           + \left|\frac{v_{ijk}^n}{\Delta y}\right| \right) \le 1.\tag{CFL}
\f]
The routine IceModel::computeMax3DVelocities() computes the 
maximum of velocity magnitudes.  This produces a time step restriction based on 
the above CFL condition.  Then IceModel::determineTimeStep() 
implements adaptive time-stepping based on this and other stability criteria.

In the analysis below we will assume an equally-spaced grid \f$z_0,\dots,z_{M_z}\f$
with \f$\Delta z = z_{k+1} - z_k\f$.  In fact PISM has a remapping scheme (options -quadZ and 
-chebZ), where the temperatures/ages in a column of ice are stored on an unequally-spaced 
vertical grid, but they are mapped to a fine, equally-spaced grid for the conservation of energy
computation described here, and for the age computation.  See procedures 
IceEnthalpyModel::enthalpyAndDrainageStep() and IceModel::ageStep(), and see
the IceModelVec3 class and IceGrid::getFineEqualVertLevsIce().

The \f$z\f$ derivative terms in (\ref vertProblem) will be approximated implicitly.  Let
\f$\lambda\f$ be in the interval \f$0 \le \lambda \le 1\f$.  The scheme BOMBPROOF is
\anchor bombone
\f{align*}
\rho_i &\left( 
       \frac{E_k^{n+1} - E_k^n}{\Delta t}
       + \lambda w_k^n \frac{E_{k+1}^{n+1} - E_{k-1}^{n+1}}{2 \Delta z}
       + (1-\lambda) w_k^{n} \frac{\Up{E_{\bullet}^{n+1}}{w_k^{n}}}{\Delta z} \right) \\
     &= k_i c_i^{-1}\, \frac{E_{k+1}^{n+1} - 2 E_{k}^{n+1} + E_{k-1}^{n+1}}{\Delta z^2} + \Phi_k^n \tag{bombone}
\f}
with the value for \f$\lambda\f$ determined by (\ref lambdachoice) below.
We have suppressed indices \f$i,j\f$.

Equation (\ref bombone) has two approximations of vertical advection.  These
two approximations are combined using nonnegative coefficients which sum to one.
Both approximations are (semi-)implicit, but the centered formula has higher accuracy,
	\f[w_k^n \frac{E_{k+1}^{n+1} - E_{k-1}^{n+1}}{2 \Delta z}
	   = w \frac{\partial E}{\partial z} + O(\Delta t,\Delta z^2),\f]
while the first order upwind formula has lower accuracy,
	\f[w_k^{n} \frac{\Up{E_{\bullet}^{n+1}}{w_k^{n}}}{\Delta z}
	   = w \frac{\partial E}{\partial z} + O(\Delta t,\Delta z).\f]
We prefer for accuracy reasons to use the centered formula, because it has 
higher order truncation error.  We will only include (implicit) upwinding when
it is needed for its added stability benefits.  This is done by the choice of
\f$\lambda\f$ below.

Let
	\f[ \nu = \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta z},
	 \qquad \text{and} \qquad R_k^n = \frac{k_i \Delta t}{\rho_i c_i \Delta z^2}.\f]
We now rewrite (\ref bombone) for computational purposes as one of a system of equations 
for the unknowns \f$\{E_k^{n+1}\}\f$.  In this system the coefficients are
scaled so that the diagonal entries of the matrix have limit one as
\f$\Delta t\to 0\f$.  That is, we multiply equation (\ref bombone) by
\f$\Delta t\f$, divide it by \f$\rho_i\f$, and rearrange:
\anchor bombtwo
\f{align*}
&\left(-R_k^n - \nu w_k^n \uppair{1-\lambda/2}{\lambda/2}\right) E_{k-1}^{n+1}  
   + \left(1 + 2 R_k^n + \nu w_k^n (1-\lambda) \uppair{+1}{-1}\right) E_k^{n+1} \tag{bombtwo} \\
&\qquad\qquad + \left(-R_k^n + \nu w_k^n \uppair{\lambda/2}{1-\lambda/2} \right) E_{k+1}^{n+1}
    = E_k^n + \Delta t \rho_i^{-1}\Phi_k^n 
\f}
Here \f$\uppair{a}{b} = a\f$ when \f$w_k^n\ge 0\f$ and \f$\uppair{a}{b} = b\f$ when \f$w_k^n < 0\f$.

Either of equivalent Equations (\ref bombone) or (\ref bombtwo) combines two unconditionally 
stable ways of approximating advection, namely implicit centered difference 
(\f$\lambda = 1\f$) and implicit first-order upwinding (\f$\lambda=0\f$).  The combination 
is "convex" because the coefficients are nonnegative and sum to one.

Regarding scaling of the equations and units, Equation (\ref bombtwo)
has coefficients which are scaled to have no units.  The diagonal coefficients on the left side 
(multiplying \f$E_k^{n+1}\f$) have continuum limit (\f$\lim_{\Delta z \to 0}\f$) of one,
while the super- and sub-diagonal coefficients have continuum limit zero.

The pure implicit centered difference scheme, namely
\anchor centered
\f{align*}
&\left(-R_k^n - \nu w_k^n/2\right) E_{k-1}^{n+1} + \left(1 + 2 R_k^n\right) E_k^{n+1} \tag{centered} \\
&\qquad\qquad + \left(-R_k^n + \nu w_k^n/2\right) E_{k+1}^{n+1} 
              = T_k^n + \Delta t \rho_i^{-1}\Phi_k^n 
\f}
is <i>less stable</i> than implicit first-order upwinding.  It is less stable 
in the same sense that Crank-Nicolson is a less stable scheme than 
backwards Euler for the simplest heat equation \f$u_t = u_{xx}\f$ [\ref MortonMayers].
In fact, although oscillatory modes cannot grow exponentially under equation (\ref centered),
those modes <i>can</i> appear when none are present already, even in the homogeneous case
\f$\Phi_k^n=0\f$.

One way of stating the greater stability of first-order upwinding is to say it satisfies a 
"maximum principle."  An example of a maximum principle for this kind of finite difference 
scheme is that if \f$U_{k-1}^n,U_k^n,U_{k+1}^n\f$ are adjacent gridded values at time step
\f$t_n\f$, and if the next value satisfies the scheme
	\f[U_k^{n+1} = C_{-1} U_{k-1}^n + C_0 U_k^n + C_{+1} U_{k+1}^n\f]
for <i>nonnegative</i> coefficients \f$C_i\f$ summing to one, \f$C_{-1} + C_0 + C_{+1} = 1\f$, 
then it follows by the triangle inequality that
	\f[\min\{|U_{k-1}^n|, |U_k^n|, |U_{k+1}^n|\} 
	       \le |U_k^{n+1}| \le \max\{|U_{k-1}^n|, |U_k^n|, |U_{k+1}^n|\}.\f]
Thus a "wiggle" cannot appear.  The proof below shows the corresponding "wiggle-free"
property for scheme (\ref bombtwo).


\section theory Stability properties of the BOMBPROOF scheme

We want to be precise about the phrase "unconditionally stable" for BOMBPROOF.
To do so we consider somewhat simplified cases which are amenable to analysis, and
we prove two stability properties, the precise advantages of BOMBPROOF.

\subsection stabilitythm Theorem (stating the stability properties).
Assume, for the precise but limited assertion of this theorem,
that the surface temperature \f$T_s\f$ and the geothermal flux \f$G\f$ are constant 
in time and space.  Assume also that the entire source function \f$\Phi\f$ is identically zero 
(but see comments below).  Fix an equally-spaced vertical grid \f$z_0=0 < z_1 < \dots < z_N=H\f$,
so that the upper grid point coincides with the surface of the ice.  Suppose \f$c_p(T)\f$ is
bounded below by a positive constant (so that equation (\ref bombtwo)
is a valid rewriting of equation (\ref bombone)).  With these assumptions, if
\anchor lambdachoice
\f[
\lambda = \min\left\{1, \quad 
	               \min_{k=0,\dots,N}\left\{\frac{2 k_i}{|w_k^n| \rho_i c_i \Delta z}\right\}
	               \quad \right\},\tag{lambdachoice}
\f]
reset at each time step \f$n\f$, then scheme (\ref bombone, \ref bombtwo) is
unconditionally-stable in the following two senses:

<ol>

<li>  A maximum principle applies without further assumptions.</li>
 
<li>  Suppose we freeze the coefficients of the problem to have constant values in time and space.
(Concretely, we assume that \f$R_k^n=R_0\f$ is a positive constant, that 
\f$\lambda\f$ is chosen independent of time step \f$n\f$, and that \f$\Delta t\f$ is 
the same for each time step.  We assume constant vertical velocity \f$w_k^n=w_0\f$.
We also consider a spatially periodic or unbounded version of our problem, 
with no boundary conditions.)
Then a von Neumann  analysis of the constant coefficient problem yields 
a growth factor less than one for all modes on the grid.
</li>
</ol>

\subsection remark Remarks.
The phrases <i>maximum principle</i> and <i>von Neumann analysis</i>
will be precisely illustrated in the following proof.  Both approaches are in 
[\ref MortonMayers].  There is additional information on the 
von Neumann analysis of implicit methods for advection in [\ref Strikwerda].

These statements also apply in case \f$k_i=0\f$, in which case (\ref lambdachoice) implies
\f$\lambda=0\f$, and the method reduces to implicit first-order upwinding.  (Implicit
first-order upwinding has properties 1 and 2 [\ref Strikwerda].)  The case \f$k_i=0\f$
is relevant because it applies to temperate ice in which there is no enthalpy conduction.
One reasonable model for temperate ice is to assume no transport of liquid fraction, diffusive
or otherwise, and to ignor conduction along the temperature gradient, because the gradient
is only from pressure-melting temperature differences.

\subsection proofone Proof of 1.

In the case considered for the maximum principle, with \f$\Phi_k^n=0\f$, 
we can rewrite (\ref bombtwo) as
\anchor formformax
\f{align*}
&\left(1 + 2 R_k^n + \nu w_k^n (1-\lambda) \uppair{+1}{-1}\right) E_k^{n+1} \\
&\qquad = E_k^n + \left(R_k^n + \nu w_k^n \uppair{1-\lambda/2}{\lambda/2}\right) E_{k-1}^{n+1}
                + \left(R_k^n - \nu w_k^n \uppair{\lambda/2}{1-\lambda/2}\right) E_{k+1}^{n+1}.
                \tag{formformax}
\f}

We claim that with choice (\ref lambdachoice) for \f$0 \le \lambda \le 1\f$, all 
coefficients in (\ref formformax) are nonnegative.  At one extreme, in 
the upwinding case (\f$\lambda=0\f$), all the coefficients are nonnegative.  Otherwise, note that
\f$\nu w_k^n (1-\lambda) \uppair{+1}{-1}\f$ is nonnegative for any valid value 
of \f$\lambda\f$ and for any value of \f$w_k^n\f$, noting the meaning of the \f$\uppair{+1}{-1}\f$
symbol.  Thus the coefficient on the left is always nonnegative.  The coefficient of 
\f$E_{k-1}^{n+1}\f$ is clearly nonnegative for any valid value of \f$\lambda\f$ if \f$w_k^n \ge 0\f$.
The coefficient of \f$E_{k+1}^{n+1}\f$ is clearly nonnegative for any valid value of \f$\lambda\f$ if 
\f$w_k^n \le 0\f$.

Therefore the only concerns are for the coefficient of \f$E_{k-1}^{n+1}\f$ when \f$w_k^n\le 0\f$ and the 
coefficient of \f$E_{k+1}^{n+1}\f$ when \f$w_k^n\ge 0\f$.  But if \f$\lambda\f$ is smaller than 
\f$2k_i/(|w_k^n| \rho_i c_i \Delta z)\f$ then 
\f{align*}
R_k^n - \nu |w_k^n| (\lambda/2) &= \frac{k_i \Delta t}{\rho_i c_i \Delta z^2}
	                                       - \frac{\Delta t |w_k^n|}{\Delta z} \frac{\lambda}{2}
	        &\ge \frac{k_i \Delta t}{\rho_i c_i \Delta z^2}
	            - \frac{\Delta t |w_k^n|}{\Delta z} \frac{k_i}{|w_k^n| \rho_i c_i \Delta z} = 0.
\f}

Thus all the coefficients in (\ref formformax) are nonnegative, and a maximum principle applies. 
<b> END OF PROOF OF 1. </b> 

\subsection prooftwo Proof of 2.
As a von Neumann analysis is much more restrictive 
than the analysis above, we will be brief here.  
Let's assume the velocity is downward, \f$w_0<0\f$; the other case 
is very similar.  Equation (\ref bombtwo) becomes 
\anchor prevonN
\f{align*}
&\left(-R_0 - \nu w_0 (\lambda/2)\right) E_{k-1}^{n+1}  
   + \left(1 + 2 R_0 - \nu w_0 (1-\lambda)\right) E_k^{n+1} \\
&\qquad\qquad + \left(-R_0 + \nu w_0 (1-\lambda/2) \right) E_{k+1}^{n+1}  = E_k^n.\tag{prevonN}
\f}

The heart of the von Neumann analysis is the substitution of a growing or decaying
(with \f$n\f$) oscillatory mode on the grid of spatial wave number \f$\mu\f$:
	\f[E_k^n = \sigma^n e^{i\mu\,(k\Delta z)}.\f]
Note \f$k\Delta z = z_k\f$ is a grid point.  Such a mode is a solution to (\ref prevonN) 
if and only if
\f{align*}
\sigma\Big[  &(-R_0-\nu w_0(\lambda/2)) e^{-i\mu\Delta z}
	              + (1+2R_0 - \nu w_0 (1-\lambda)) \\
	           &\quad   + (-R_0  + \nu w_0 (\lambda/2)) e^{+i\mu\Delta z}
	                    + \nu w_0 (1-\lambda) e^{+i\mu\Delta z} \Big] = 1.
\f}
This equation reduces by standard manipulations to
	\f[\sigma = \frac{1}{1 + \left(4 R_0 - 2 \nu w_0 (1-\lambda)\right)\cos^2(\mu \Delta z/2)
	                      + i\,\nu w_0 (1-\lambda/2)\sin(\mu\Delta z)}.\f]
Note \f$4 R_0 - 2 \nu w_0 (1-\lambda) \ge 0\f$ without restrictions on 
numerical parameters \f$\Delta t\f$, \f$\Delta z\f$, because \f$w_0<0\f$ in the 
case under consideration.  Therefore
	\f[|\sigma|^2 = \frac{1}{\left[1 + \left(4 R_0 - 2 \nu w_0 (1-\lambda)\right)
	                              \cos^2(\mu \Delta z/2)\right]^2
	                      + \left[\nu w_0 (1-\lambda/2)\sin(\mu\Delta z)\right]^2} < 1,\f]
and it follows that all modes decay exponentially.  <b> END OF PROOF OF 2. </b>


\subsection remarktwo Remark about our von Neumann stability analysis.

The constant \f$\lambda\f$ is carefully chosen in (\ref lambdachoice) so that the 
maximum principle <i>(I)</i> applies.  On the other hand, both the 
implicit first-order upwind and the implicit centered difference formulas have
unconditional stability in the von Neumann sense.  The proof of case
<i>(II)</i> above is thus a formality, merely showing that a
convex combination of unconditionally stable (von Neumann sense) schemes is still
unconditionally stable in the same sense.


\subsection maxconsequence Convergence: a consequence of the maximum principle.
 
If we define the pointwise numerical error [\ref MortonMayers] 
\f$e_k^n = E_k^n - E(t_n,x_i,y_j,z_k)\f$, where \f$E(\dots)\f$ is the unknown
exact solution (exact enthalpy field), then (\ref formformax) implies an equality of the form
	\f[A e_k^{n+1} = e_k^n + B_- e_{k-1}^{n+1} + B_+ e_{k+1}^{n+1} + \Delta t\, \tau_k^n\f]
where \f$\tau_k^n\f$ is the truncation error of the scheme and \f$A,B_\pm\f$ are nonnegative 
coefficients.  Note that
	\f[B_- + B_+ = 2 R_k^n + \nu w_k^n (1-\lambda) \uppair{+1}{-1}.\f]

Letting \f${\bar e}^n = \max_k |e_k^n|\f$ we have, because of the positivity of coefficients,
\anchor prebound

for all \f$k\f$, where \f$\bar\tau^n = \max_k |\tau_k^n|\f$.  Now let \f$k\f$ be the index for 
which \f$|e_k^{n+1}| = {\bar e}^{n+1}\f$.  For that \f$k\f$ we can replace \f$|e_k^{n+1}|\f$ in 
equation (\ref prebound) with \f${\bar e}^{n+1}\f$.  Subtracting the same quantity from 
each side of the resulting inequality gives
\f[
{\bar e}^{n+1} \le {\bar e}^n + \Delta t\,\bar\tau^n,
\f]
Thus have a maximum principle for BOMBPROOF, and have used it to prove convergence 
in the standard way [\ref MortonMayers].  Of course, this convergence proof has the same
assumptions as case 1. in the theorem, and thus does not actually prove convergence
in a full range of glaciologically-interesting cases.


\subsection final Final remark: nonzero source term.

Now recall we assumed in Theorem 1 that the entire "source" \f$\Phi_k^n\f$ was identically zero.
Of course this is not realistic.  What we understand is provable, however, is that if a
numerical scheme for a linear advection/conduction equation
	\f[u_t + A u_x = B u_{xx}\f]
is stable in the general sense of numerical schemes for partial differential equations
(%e.g. as defined in subsection 5.5 of [\ref MortonMayers]) then the same scheme is stable 
in the same general sense when applied to the equation with (linear) lower order terms:
	\f[u_t + A u_x = B u_{xx} + C u + D.\f]
A precise statement of this general fact is hard to find in the literature, 
to put it mildly, but theorem 2.2.3 of [\ref Strikwerda] is one interesting case
(\f$B=0\f$ and \f$D=0\f$).  But even the form we state with linear term (\f$C u + D\f$)
is not adequate to the job because of the strongly-nonlinear dependence of \f$\Phi\f$
on the temperature \f$T\f$ [\ref BBL].

Nonetheless the maximum principle is a highly-desirable
form of stability because we can exclude "wiggles" from the finite difference approximations
of the conductive and advective terms, even if the complete physics, with strain heating in particular,
is not yet shown to be non-explosive [\ref BBL].  Recall that, because we use first-order upwinding
on the horizontal advection terms, we can expect maximum principle-type behavior of the 
whole scheme.


\section bedrock A finite difference scheme for the bedrock thermal layer

Real ice sheet modeling includes the recognition that, because sensible heat flux is proportional
to temperature differences, the time-dependent geothermal contribution to the energy in the ice sheet
is related to the temperature in the ice itself.  This is a feedback mechanism that can,
and should, for completeness, be modeled  [\ref RitzFabreLetreguilly].

For instance, suppose the ice sheet is in a state in which the geothermal flux deep in the
crust is equal to the heat flux into the ice base.  If the ice cools from this state then, 
because the temperature gradient is now greater in magnitude, between the warm bedrock 
and the cooler ice, the ice will for some period receive more than the deep geothermal 
flux rate. Similarly, if the ice warms from the equal state then the temperature difference
with the bedrock has become smaller and the magnitude of the ice basal heat flux
will be less than the deep geothermal rate.  Cooling and warming of the ice can occur
because of atmospheric climate changes but also because of changes in the flow (%e.g.
changes in strain heating, or the advection of cooler/warmer ice).

Because the relevant layer of bedrock below an ice sheet is again very shallow, and
because we can neglect all crustal flow, modeling the 
energy content, in our case the enthalpy \f$E(t,x,y,z)\f$, is quite simple.
The equation has only vertical conduction:
  \f[ \rho_b \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} = k_b c_b^{-1}  \frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial z^2}. \f]
Here we assume \f$\rho_b,k_b,c_b\f$ are constant material properties.  Note
that EnthalpyConverter includes a choice for converting between enthalpy
and temperature in bedrock: \f$E=E(T,p),\quad T=T(E,p)\f$.  For now the method
choosen is uninteresting.

Because there is no advection, our scheme is easily "bombproof" without choosing 
\f$\lambda\f$, or other complications.  In particular we use the simplest centered 
implicit (backward Euler) scheme and quickly get this normalized form,
  \f[ -R_b E_{k-1}^{n+1} + \left(1 + 2 R_b\right) E_k^{n+1} + -R_b E_{k+1}^{n+1}
         = E_k^n, \f]
where 
  \f[ R_b = \frac{k_b \Delta t}{\rho_b c_b \Delta z^2}. \f]
This is unconditionally stable (for a pure bedrock problem), and has a maximum
principle, without any further qualification [\ref MortonMayers].


\section icebedrock A finite difference scheme at the ice-bedrock transition

The ice/bedrock interface is another matter.  For this special location we must make
a somewhat elaborate argument, a finite volume argument.  In particular, because 
the enthalpy has different dependence on temperature in ice and bedrock, there is an
inevitable enthalpy jump at the ice-bedrock transition.  In fact, \f$\partial E/\partial T\f$
has different values in ice and in bedrock, so we cannot choose normalizations in
ice and in bedrock with the property that there is no jump in enthalpy at the
ice-bedrock interface.

Consider \ref figure1 "Figure 1" which has volume \f$V\f$ surrounded by a dotted line.
We will integrate our conservation of energy equation
  \f[ \rho \frac{dE}{dt} = -\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} + Q \f]
over \f$V\f$.  Volume \f$V\f$ is between levels \f$z=-\epsilon\f$ and 
\f$z=+\epsilon\f$, where \f$\epsilon=\Delta z/2\f$, and we denote its upper and lower
halves by \f$V^\pm\f$, respectively.

\anchor figure1
\image html enthinterface.png "Figure 1.  At the ice-bedrock transition."

Before integrating, recall the different forms for heat flux \f$\mathbf{q}\f$
(\ref heatflux), and the meaning of the material derivative \f$dE/dt\f$.  Also, 
note that the lower half \f$V^-\f$ is boring (only vertical
conduction) while the upper half \f$V^+\f$ is interesting (vertical conduction 
\e plus advection \e plus strain heating).

Now, by the divergence theorem [\ref Schey],
  \f[ \int_{V} \rho \frac{dE}{dt}
        = - \int_V \nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} + \int_V Q
        = - \int_{\partial V} \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{n} + \int_V Q \f]
where \f$\partial V\f$ is the entire boundary
of \f$V\f$ and \f$\mathbf{n}\f$ is the outward unit normal vector field.

The fact that \f$\Delta z \ll \Delta x\f$, which is to say the shallowness of the
continuum model, justifies neglecting the sides of \f$V\f$ and only integrating over
the top and bottom, surfaces \f$S^\pm\f$ in \ref figure1 "Figure 1".  On \f$S^\pm\f$
the outward unit normal is the vertical unit vector: \f$\mathbf{n}=\pm \mathbf{z}\f$.
Also, the integral on the left side of the equation breaks into two parts in which
the densities are constant, and only the upper part is a flowing material (with
three-dimensional velocity \f$\mathbf{U}\f$).  Thus we have
  \f[ \rho_i \int_{V^+} \frac{\partial E}{\partial t}
         + \rho_i \int_{V^+} \mathbf{U} \cdot \nabla E
         + \rho_b \int_{V^-} \frac{\partial E}{\partial t}
        = - \int_{S^+} \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{z}
          - \int_{S^-} \mathbf{q} \cdot (-\mathbf{z}) + \int_V Q \f]

Let \f$A=\Delta x\Delta y\f$, the cross-sectional area of our column of ice, so
\f$2 \epsilon A\f$ is the volume of \f$V\f$.  Let 
  \f[ \bar Q = (\epsilon A)^{-1} \int_V Q.  \f]
This quantity will be addressed later.

Also we will treat horizontal and vertical advection by different schemes.  We split
the integral
  \f[ \int_{V^+} \mathbf{U} \cdot \nabla E
      = \int_{V^+} \left(u \frac{\partial E}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial E}{\partial y}\right)
       + \int_{V^+} w \frac{\partial E}{\partial z}.  \f] 
Let
  \f[ I = (\epsilon A)^{-1} \int_{V^+} \left(u \frac{\partial E}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial E}{\partial y}\right). \f]

Consider cold ice only.  In this case,
  \f[ \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{z} = \begin{cases}
                                      - k_i c_i^{-1} \frac{\partial E}{\partial z}, & z>0, \\
                                      - k_b c_b^{-1} \frac{\partial E}{\partial z}, & z<0.
                                    \end{cases} \f]

So, here is the equation from which we will produce a finite difference equation
corresponding to the $z=0$ grid point in a vertical column of ice:
  \f[ \rho_i \int_{V^+} \frac{\partial E}{\partial t}
         + \rho_b \int_{V^-} \frac{\partial E}{\partial t}
        = k_i c_i^{-1} \int_{S^+} \frac{\partial E}{\partial z}
          - k_b c_b^{-1} \int_{S^-} \frac{\partial E}{\partial z}
          - \rho_i \int_{V^+} w \frac{\partial E}{\partial z}
          - \rho_i \epsilon A I + \epsilon A \bar Q. \f]

Let \f$E_{0^+}^n\f$ be the value of the enthalpy in the ice
at the grid point at \f$z=0\f$.  Let \f$E_{0^-}^n\f$ be the value of the enthalpy 
in the bedrock at the grid point at \f$z=0\f$.  These are not generally the same value; 
we will allow a jump at \f$z=0\f$ in the enthalpy, even as we enforce continuity of temperature
at that location.

The scheme will be implicit (backward Euler).  We use the same notation as in describing 
the core of BOMBPROOF above.  For the left side of the equation, we approximate
\f$E\f$ in \f$V^\pm\f$ by its value at \f$z=0\f$, respectively, making a \f$O(\Delta z)\f$
error right away.  Then
  \f[ \rho_i \epsilon A \frac{E_{0^+}^{n+1} - E_{0^+}^n}{\Delta t}
         + \rho_b \epsilon A \frac{E_{0^-}^{n+1} - E_{0^-}^n}{\Delta t}
        = k_i c_i^{-1} A \frac{E_{+1}^{n+1} - E_{0^+}^{n+1}}{\epsilon}
          - k_b c_b^{-1} A \frac{E_{0^-}^{n+1} - E_{-1}^{n+1}}{\epsilon}
          - \rho_i \epsilon A \frac{ \Up{w}{ E_\bullet^{n+1} } }{\epsilon}
          - \rho_i \epsilon A I + \epsilon A \bar Q. \f]
Divide by \f$\epsilon A\f$:
  \f[ \rho_i \frac{E_{0^+}^{n+1} - E_{0^+}^n}{\Delta t}
         + \rho_b \frac{E_{0^-}^{n+1} - E_{0^-}^n}{\Delta t}
        = k_i c_i^{-1} \frac{E_{+1}^{n+1} - E_{0^+}^{n+1}}{\epsilon^2}
          - k_b c_b^{-1} \frac{E_{0^-}^{n+1} - E_{-1}^{n+1}}{\epsilon^2}
          - \rho_i \frac{ \Up{w}{ E_\bullet^{n+1} } }{\epsilon}
          - \rho_i I + \bar Q. \f]
Let
  \f[ \hat\rho = \frac{\rho_i}{\rho_b} \f]
and define
  \f[ R_i = \frac{k_i \Delta t}{c_i \rho_i \epsilon^2}, \qquad
      R_b = \frac{k_b \Delta t}{c_b \rho_b \epsilon^2}, \qquad
      \nu = \frac{\Delta t}{\epsilon}.  \f]
Multiply both sides of our evolving equation by \f$\Delta t/\rho_b\f$ to get:
  \f[ \hat\rho (E_{0^+}^{n+1} - E_{0^+}^n) + (E_{0^-}^{n+1} - E_{0^-}^n)
        = \hat\rho R_i (E_{+1}^{n+1} - E_{0^+}^{n+1}) - R_b (E_{0^-}^{n+1} - E_{-1}^{n+1})
          - \hat\rho \nu \Up{w}{ E_\bullet^{n+1} }
          - \Delta t \hat\rho I + \Delta t (\rho_b)^{-1} \bar Q. \f]

Because this is a line in a system of equations for the new values, we re-arrange with the
unknowns on the left:
