### I was thinking this might be useful at the top of the References html page:

# \par Notes
# - This large list collects all references which the PISM authors have found
# convenient.  There is no claim that all of these references get direct use,
# or even mention, in the PISM project files. 

### But it would seem that such text would need to go in the .bst file?
