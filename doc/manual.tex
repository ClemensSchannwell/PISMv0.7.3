\section{Getting started}

\subsection{Using \t{run\underline{ }ice} for Antarctica}  [FIXME FOR \verb|~/ice-input/ant_2006/init.nc|]British Antarctica Survey supplied data [REFERENCE?] for the current state of the Antarctic ice sheet is stored in a NetCDF file \t{bas\underline{ }2004.nc} included with the release.  We start by showing how it can be loaded as the initial data of an Antarctica simulation.  We assume that the release has been built; see the \textbf{Installation} section.

The command ``\t{./run\underline{ }ice -if ...}'' here wraps past the end of the line.  We will explain the options below and in later sections, but furthermore we will describe shell scripts which simplify things.

Consider the behaviors specified at the command line.  The BAS data file \t{bas\underline{ }2004.nc} is located in a directory \t{ice-input} and is specified as the input file.  \emph{The grid is specified at the command line}, as $121\times 121 \times (81+21)$.  The vertical grid is 81 equally-spaced levels within the ice and an additional 21 within the bed below.  The next option ``\t{-no\underline{ }mass\underline{ }balance}'' turns off changes to the surface elevation.  (In this case we start from observed data which does not include a temperature field within the ice.  The run here could be the first step on computing such a field based on the default assumption that the Antarctic ice sheet is roughly in equilibrium.)  The next option chooses the Goldsby-Kohlstedt \cite{GoldsbyKohlstedt} flow law, and the one after that chooses an enhancement factor of 2.0.  The run is run for the default time of 1000 model years; this can be specified as in the next example.  Finally, and this part of the output is not shown, four diagnostic windows are chosen, which show, respectively, a color map-plane contour views of vertically-averaged horizontal ice speed (``\t{c}''), of surface elevation (``\t{h}''), of basal temperature (``\t{T}''), and of the strain heating term in the temperature equation (``\t{S}'').

The code starts by showing a ``PETSc bag'' containing all the fundamental numerical parameters and a bit more start-up information.

At each time step we get a summary of the model state at the end of the step.  The format of the summary is
\scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
    $$$$      YEAR (+   STEP):     VOL    AREA    MELTF     THICK0     TEMP0
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
The first four columns are flags telling the user which quantities are being updated at each time step: ``\texttt{v}'' or ``\texttt{V}'' for velocity, ``\texttt{t}'' for temperature, ``\texttt{g}'' for grain size, and ``\texttt{f}'' for surface elevation (i.e.~a step of the flow equation has occurred); a placeholder ``\verb|$|'' appears if the given quantity is not updated.  (Lower case ``\texttt{v}'' indicates that the 3D velocity field has been updated, e.g.~as needed for the advection of temperature, while uppercase ``\texttt{V}'' indicates that the vertically-averaged velocity, and the associated diffusivity, has been updates.)  The time and time step are in years.  The next three columns are the volume of the ice in $10^6 \,\text{km}^3$, the area covered by the ice in $10^6\,\text{km}^2$, and the basal melt fraction, that is, the fraction of the ice area where the basal homologous temperature is above $273.0$ (i.e.~slightly lower than the melting temperature, actually).  The next two columns ``\texttt{THICK0}'' and ``\texttt{TEMP0}'' are values at the center of the computational domain, that is, the thickness at the origin in meters, and the basal absolute temperature at the origin in Kelvin.  This summary of the model state can be expanded by using the option \verb|-verbose|.
 
Note that the time step is adaptively determined.  The volume and area do not change in this run because this model run has no mass balance evolution.  The values ``\t{THICK0}'' and ``\t{TEMP0}'' happen to be at the South Pole in this case.  Several times during the run the grain size was update.  Grain size is computed based upon (roughly) modeled age of the ice and on grain size data from the Vostok core [REFERENCE]; the grain size is a parameter in the Goldsby-Kohlstedt flow law.  At the end of the run the model state is saved in a PETSc binary format file ``\t{unnamed.pb}''; an output filename may be chosen at the command line, of course.


\subsection{A \t{verify} run}  [FIXME: RERUN GIVEN VARIOUS UPDATES]  The purpose of a \t{verify} run is to establish that the code closely approximates an exact solution to the continuum equations of the model, and thus to check on the correctness of the code.  Thus \t{verify} should be used when major changes occur but also to understand the limits on reportable accuracy.  Of course the exact solutions have significantly simplified, in some cases not very physical, boundary conditions and sources.  On the other hand there are several types of exact solution based tests which verify several parts of the code, including isothermal mass balance, thermocoupling, and sliding.  The underlying ice model code executed by \t{verify} is identical to that executed by \verb|run_ice|, but the command line options are somewhat different.

Here is a basic isothermal example:

Several behaviors were specified at the command line.  First, the code was \emph{run in parallel} under MPI (\texttt{www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/index.htm}) on two processors.  The exact solution Test B from \cite{BLKCB}, the Halfar solution \cite{Halfar83}, was used as the initial condition.  It is a zero accumulation isothermal solution and, instead of starting at a default time and specifying the number of years to run, here the starting and ending times as recommended in \cite{BLKCB} were given by options ``\t{-ys}'' and ``\t{-ye}''.  Note that as the sheet became thinner the adaptive time-stepping scheme lengthened the steps to the (default) maximum time step of 60 years.  A grid with $31\times 31$ points in the horizontal was used, matching the EISMINT 1996 choice \cite{EISMINT96} in the horizontal.  No diagnostic viewers were requested though they are available.

Errors at the final time are reported relative to the exact solution \cite{BLKCB}.  Note that the ``\t{-eo}'' flag can be given so that \t{verify} produces only the exact solution and does no numerics:
\beginV
    user@host:~/ice$ ./verify -test B -ys 422.45 -ye 25000.0 -Mx 31 -My 31 -eo
\end{verbatim}
\Vend

\subsection{Running EISMINT II experiments}  For the user who wants to see the EISMINT I \cite{EISMINT96}, EISMINT II \cite{EISMINT00}, ISMIP [FIXME: NOT IMPLEMENTED! CITATION?] as performed by this numerical ice sheet model, there is a separate executable ``\verb|simplify|'' which is runs identical code to ``\verb|run_ice|'' but does not require an initialization file and automatically sets up the correct, simplified experimental conditions (i.e. initial/boundary values and sources).  For example,
\beginV
    user@host:~/ice$ ./simplify -eisII F -Mx 61 -My 61 -Mz 201 -y 200000 -o eisF_61_201
\end{verbatim}
\Vend
runs EISMINT II experiment F for the prescribed $200$k years and saves the result in \verb|eisF_61_201.pb| for inspection.  This particular run takes a while, and also shows the infamous spokes.


\subsection{Regridding}  \normalspacing Running ice sheet simulations on fine grids takes a long time.  One technique to reduce computational time is to do computations on a rough grid and then refine the result.  The \verb|-regrid| option does this.  For example, the following does EISMINT II experiment F starting on a very rough grid and then regriding eventually onto a fine $12.5$ km horizontal grid with 200 vertical levels:
[FIXME: this example can be simplified: remove -y 0 runs]
\beginV
    user@host:~/ice$ ./simplify -eisII F -Mx 31 -My 31 -Mz 31 -y 175000 -o eisF_31_31_175k
       [RUN OF 20 minutes]
    user@host:~/ice$ ./simplify -eisII F -y 0 -Mx 61 -My 61 -Mz 61 -regrid eisF_31_31_175k.pb \
    > -regrid_vars hHTe -o eisF_61_61
    user@host:~/ice$ ./simplify -eisII F -if eisF_61_61.pb -y 20000 -o eisF_61_61_195k
       [RUN OF 30 minutes]
    user@host:~/ice$ ./simplify -eisII F -y 0 -Mx 121 -My 121 -Mz 201 -regrid eisF_61_61_195k.pb \
    > -regrid_vars hHTe -o eisF_121_201
    user@host:~/ice$ ./simplify -eisII F -if eisF_121_201.pb -y 5000 -o eisF_121_201_200k
       [RUN OF 7 HOURS]
\end{verbatim}
\Vend
Note that the runs which have the \verb|-y 0| option either create a grid or regrid data on one grid onto another grid.  In either case no evolution occurs, obviously.  Note that the option \verb|-regrid_vars|, which has no argument, though a string giving a list of variables names is allowed (see below), indicates that all of the information in the \verb|-regrid| file will be regridded onto the new grid indicated by the \verb|-if| file.


\subsection{Visualizing the results}  There are three modes for visualizing the various quantities in this ice model.\begin{itemize}
\item At runtime various diagnostic viewers can be specified; see the Usage subsection below.  These viewers are updated at each step.  The format is limited by the style of PETSc viewers (see below) but in fact these viewers suffice for most routine diagnostic purposes.
\item A \Matlab output file, in particular \Matlab script, can be produced by the options \verb|-o foo -of m|.  (This produces a file \verb|foo.m| in the current directory.)  When executed in \Matlab this script produces a variety of useful figures both for diagnostic purposes and for publishable results.  The script contains large amounts of data from the model but size concerns have limited us to outputing only surface elevation, temperature, and the strain-heating term in the temperature evolution equation.  Note that only slices of the temperature and strain-heating term are saved.  The locations of these slices can be controlled by the options \verb|-id|, \verb|-jd|, \verb|-kd|; see below.  If the executable \verb|verify| is used for a thermocoupled test then an additional file \verb|foo_comp.m| will be produced which corrects the strain-heating term and reports the compensatory heating term as well \cite{BKL}.  A possibly useful additional \Matlab script \verb|icemodelfigs| is also in the distribution; it was used to produce the figures in \cite{BKL}.
\item The state of the model can be output in NetCDF format.  [\emph{THIS OPTION IS NOT CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED}]
\end{itemize}


\section{Installation}

With any luck installation is not too much harder than installing PETSc itself.  We recommend that MPI [reference], XWindows [reference], NetCDF [reference], GSL [reference], FFTW [reference], and PETSc [reference] be installed first [IN WHAT ORDER?].  NetCDF, GSL, and FFTW are optional, see below.

\subsection{Example: bash shell, using GNU tar and wget, with NetCDF, GSL, and FFTW already installed and with (e.g.) OpenMPI}

\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}
mkdir safe
cd safe
wget http://www.dms.uaf.edu/~bueler/commvnism.tar.gz  # FIXME: where sources be?
tar -xvvf commvnism.tar.gz
cd ice
export WITH_NETCDF=1
export WITH_GSL=1
export WITH_FFTW=1
make   # may take a minute or two at most
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\subsection{Example: csh shell, using GNU tar and wget, with NetCDF and FFTW NOT installed and with (e.g.) OpenMPI}

\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}
mkdir safe
cd safe
wget http://www.dms.uaf.edu/~bueler/commvnism.tar.gz
tar -xvvf commvnism.tar.gz
cd ice
setenv WITH_NETCDF 0
setenv WITH_FFTW 0
setenv WITH_GSL 1
make
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\subsection{If it builds} Some quick tests of basic functionality might be:
\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}
./verify -test G -y 100 
./run_ice -if ../ice-input/ant_2006/init.nc -Mx 91 -My 91 -Mz 101 -y 500 -d Hgf -dbig cT
./verify -test H -y 40034 -Mx 31 -My 31 -Mz 11 -bed_def_lc
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
The first \t{verify} run is to test the core thermcoupled shallow ice approximation code and the basic I/O to standard out.  The \verb|run_ice| run tests NetCDF and diagnosic viewers which use X windows.  The second \t{verify} run tests the bed deformation code which uses FFTW and GSL.

\newcommand{\optdef}[2]{\vspace{1mm}\noindent \large\texttt{-#1}\,[\textsl{#2}]:\quad\normalsize}
\newcommand{\und}{$\underline{\,\,\,}$}

\subsection{Command line options for \t{run\_ice} and \t{simplify}}  Much of the behavior of the ice model can be set at the command line.  

As a PETSc program all PETSc options are available \cite{petsc-web-page,petsc-user-ref}.  The next subsection recalls some of these PETSc options, but in this subsection we list the commands which are special to our ice sheet model.  Note that all of the parameters reported as part of the ``\verb|PetscBag Object|'' at the beginning of a run may be altered by the user, but some are not recommended for user modification.  

The format of the following option documentation is

\centerline{``\optdef{optionname}{default value} Description.''}
\bigskip

\optdef{adapt\und ratio}{0.12}  Adaptive time stepping ratio for the explicit scheme for the mass balance equation.

\opt{bed\und def} Same as \verb|-bed_def_lc| below.

\opt{bed\und def\und iso} Compute bed deformations by simple pointwise isostasy.  Assumes that the bed at the starting time is in equilibrium with the load so the bed elevation is equal to the starting bed elevation minus a multiple of the increase in ice thickness from the starting time, roughly: $b(t,x,y) = b(0,x,y) - f [H(t,x,y) - H(0,x,y)]$.  Here $f$ is the density of ice divided by the density of the mantle.

\opt{bed\und def\und lc} Compute bed deformations, caused by the changing load of the ice, using a viscoelastic earth model.  Uses the model and computational technique described in \cite{BLKfastearth}, based on the continuum model in \cite{LingleClark}.  [\emph{At present, assumes that the bed at the starting time is in equilibrium with the load.  Need uplift map to correctly initialize.}]

\optdef{constant\und nu}{30.0}  If this option is used then the MacAyeal velocities (see \verb|-mv| below) are computed with a constant viscosity.  If this option is not used then the viscosities are computed by a nonlinear iteration.  The argument is given in units of MPa a, and the default value is $30$ MPa a, the value given in \cite{Ritzetal2001}.

\opt{d}  Specifies diagnostic (X Windows) viewers.  See subsection below on diagnostic viewers.

\opt{dbig}  Specifies larger (about twice linear dimensions) diagnostic viewers.  See subsection below.

\opt{dx}  \emph{Use of this option is not recommended.}  \verb|dx| is computed internally as \verb|2*Lx/(Mx-1)|.  The user may alter \verb|Lx| or \verb|Mx| at the command line.

\opt{dy}  \emph{Use of this option is not recommended.}  \verb|dy| is computed internally as \verb|2*Ly/(My-1)|.  The user may alter \verb|Ly| or \verb|My| at the command line.

\opt{dz}  \emph{Use of this option is not recommended.}  \verb|dz| is computed internally as \verb|Lz/(Mz-1)|.  The user may alter \verb|Lz| or \verb|Mz| at the command line.

\optdef{e}{1.0}  Flow enhancement factor.

\optdef{eisII}{A}  [\emph{Only available in } \verb|simplify|.]  Choose single character name of EISMINT II \cite{EISMINT00} simplified geometry experiment.

\opt{history}  \emph{Use of this option is not recommended.}  It is usually desirable to keep the stored command history unaltered.

\opt{id}

\opt{if}  The model can be started from either a PETSc binary file written by the model, e.g.~\verb|foo.pb|, or certain NetCDF files with sufficient information to start, e.g.~\verb|bas_2004.nc|.

\opt{isoflux}  Isothermal runs can be done by two methods.  One may simply initialize with a constant temperature field and then turn off temperature evolution (see \verb|-no_temp|); in this case the horizontal velocity and the horizontal mass flux are computed by a vertical numerical integral.  If the option \verb|-isoflux| is used then the mass flux is computed by the usual isothermal, Glen formula without reference to the temperature field or the chosen flow law.

\opt{gk}  [\emph{Not available in } \verb|verify|.]  Sets the flow law to Goldsby-Kohlstedt.  Same as \verb|-law 4|.  [\emph{Option included for backward compatibility.}  See \verb|-law| for more complete option choice of flow law.]

\item The Paterson-Budd \cite{PatersonBudd} flow law with exponent $n=3$.  In particular there is split ``Arrhenius'' term $A(T) = A \exp(-Q/RT^*)$ where $(A = 3.615 \times 10^{-13}\, \text{s}^{-1}\, \text{Pa}^{-3}, Q = 6.0 \times 10^4\, \text{J}\, \text{mol}^{-1})$ if $T^* < 263$ K and $(A = 1.733 \times 10^{3}\, \text{s}^{-1}\, \text{Pa}^{-3}, Q = 13.9 \times 10^4\, \text{J}\, \text{mol}^{-1})$ if $T^* > 263$ K and where $T^*$ is the homologous temperature.  Also $R=8.314\, \text{J}\, \text{mol}^{-1}\, \text{K}^{-1}$.

\optdef{no\und spokes}{0}  The strain heating term can be smoothed by averaging the neighboring horizontal neighbors (those which are within the ice).  The integer parameter controls the number of neighboring grid points over which the average is computed.

\subsection{Diagnostic viewers} Many basic views of the changing state of the ice model are available at the command line by using the options ``\t{-d}'' and ``\t{-dbig}'' with additional arguments.  For instance:
\begin{verbatim}
   ./run_ice ... -d hTg -dbig c
\end{verbatim}
shows a map-plane views of surface elevation (``\t{h}''), temperature at the level specified by \t{-kd} (``\t{T}''), rate of change of thickness (``\t{g}'') and of vertically-averaged horizontal ice speed (``\t{c}'').

The option \t{-d} is followed by a space and then a list of single-character names of the diagnositic viewers.  The option \t{-dbig} works exactly the same way, with the same list of single-character names available.  The bigger viewers take precedence, so that ``\t{-d hT -dbig T}'' shows two viewers, namely a regular size viewer for surface elevation and a larger viewer for temperature.  

\emph{Warning: At this point the diagnostic viewers only work with one processor.}

The single character names are:

\subsection{User's overview of the code}  This ice sheet model is implemented as a collection of C++ object classes [REFERENCE], the most central of which is \t{IceModel}.

More elementary than \t{IceModel} are the classes\begin{itemize}
\item \t{IceGrid}, which describes the shape of the grid and parallel
layout. This abstraction could be used to streamline transferring model data between
different grids.
\item \t{MaterialType}.  Various materials are derived from the class \t{MaterialType} which merely defines a couple
physical constants. \t{IceType} is still an abstract class which defines the interface to
ice flow. Concrete classes derived from \t{IceType} are \t{ThermoGlenIce} (which uses the
EISMINT constants) and \t{GKIce} as well as \t{HybridIce}.  Similarly, there is \t{BedrockType} and \t{OceanType} which merely define
associated physical constants.\end{itemize}

An example derived class of \t{IceType} is \t{HybridIce}, as mentioned.  Note that it is difficult, at least, to implement a complete Goldsby-Kohlstedt ice type \cite{GoldsbyKohlstedt} since the inverse constitutive
relation is required for computation of MacAyeal-type ice shelf and dragging ice shelf \cite{MacAyeal} velocity fields. \t{HybridIce} is Goldsby-Kohlstedt ice in the interior of the ice sheet and Glen ice in ice streams and
shelves.

The methods for \t{IceModel} are many.  They initialize the model (from input data files or from formulas describing various exact solutions), they read user options, they allocate arrays in a distributed manner under PETSc, they compute the terms in the various continuum equations (mass balance, conservation of energy, and velocity), they control diagnostic viewers, they run the central time-stepping, and they write out the model state to files.

A derived class of \t{IceModel} called \t{IceCompModel} is used for verification; see the next section.  It has additional structures which allows \t{IceModel} to have compensatory sources and compute initial conditions from, and especially to report errors relative to, known exact solutions \cite{BLKCB,BKL,BK}.

There are two established drivers which call constructors and destructors for \t{IceModel}, namely \verb|run_ice| and \verb|verify|; examples appear above.  These drivers include no computation but differ in which class is constructed (\t{IceModel} vs \t{IceCompModel}) and in how certain options are handled.  They invoke the same numerical proceedures to handle the various partial differential equations of the continuum model, and this fact, along with the derived class relation for \t{IceCompModel}, is at the heart of the verification mechanism.  Driver \verb|run_ice| should be used for actual ice sheet computations, based on data files which will typically be in NetCDF form.  Driver \verb|run_ice| should also be used for simulations of symmetrical or artificial sheets for which no exact solution is known (and, obviously, for which no compensatory sources are needed) such as the EISMINT experiments \cite{EISMINT96,EISMINT00}.  Driver \verb|verify| is simply for verification and reports errors relative to exact solutions.



\section{Verification}

\subsection{Exact solutions and compensatory sources in a derived class}  Various exact solutions and compensatory models are implemented in a class \t{IceCompModel} which is derived from \t{IceModel}.  This derived class leaves \t{IceModel} free of non-physical exact solution information.  Thus \t{IceModel} only contains information directly appropriate for actual ice sheet simulation, while verification using \t{IceCompModel} tests exactly the same codes as are used by actual simulations but adds the necessary code to use compensatory sources and to initialize with and verify against exact solutions.

\t{IceCompModel} includes a material class \t{ThermoArrGlenIce} which has a pure Arrhenius term, unlike \t{ThermoGlenIce} which has a cold and warm regime for the exponential term.  The class reimplements \t{run()} and updates the compensatory terms during the time step.

Note that the melt fraction is computed using the absolute temperature not the homologous temperature as in \verb|run_ice|.

\subsection{Command line options for \t{verify}}  Essentially all of the command line options for \verb|run_ice| apply to \t{verify}.  The only option not available to \t{verify} is ``\t{-circular}''.  The new options are

\opt{eo}  Only exact evolution is shown; no actual numerics are performed.  This option used in company with diagnosic viewers (\verb|-d |\dots) allows the user to visualize the exact solutions themselves.

\opt{noreport}  Turns off error report at final time.

\opt{test}  This option currently only allow values \t{B,C,D,F,G}.  Tests \t{B,C,D} are documented in \cite{BLKCB} while tests \t{F,G} are in \cite{BKL} with more detail in \cite{BK}.  The recommended \t{verify} runs are:\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|  ./verify -test B -ys 422.45 -y 25000|
\item \verb|  ./verify -test C -y 15208.0|
\item \verb|  ./verify -test D -y 25000|
\item \verb|  ./verify -test F -y 25000|
\item \verb|  ./verify -test G -y 25000|
\end{itemize}
For the thermocoupled runs it is strongly recommended that at least $100$ vertical levels are used.



\section{PETSc}

\subsection{PETSc Preliminaries}
The PETSc library \cite{petsc-web-page,petsc-user-ref,petsc-efficient} provides essential support for distributed arrays and linear solvers in a parallel computing environment.  ``PETSc'' stands for ``Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation.''  Specifically,it is a suite of data structures and routines in the C language, primarily, for the scalable (parallel) solution of scientific applications modeled by partial differential equations.  Large parts of PETSc relate especially to finite-difference type regular, rectangular grids.

Documentation for PETSc is available from the web site at \url{http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-as/}.

PETSc employs the MPI standard for all message-passing communication.  See the next section.

Most variables in a PETSc program are of newly-defined distributed types including
\begin{verbatim}
DA   da;
Vec  v;
KSP  ksp;
\end{verbatim}
In fact most of the PETSc types merely declare pointers but they should be regarded as objects (abstract data types).  The objects must be created with calls to functions like \t{DACreate2d()}, \t{VecCreate()}, etc.  They should be destroyed when they are not needed with calls to corresponding \t{Destroy()} functions.

\subsection{Distributed arrays and vectors}
PETSc has an abstract date type called a distributed array. Objects of type DA contain
information about the grid and stencil. They can have information about coordinates, but
the code does not use this feature at present. Vectors are created with
\texttt{DAVecCreate()} and similar. These vectors will be distributed across the
processors as indicated by the distributed array.

There are two parameters of note: stencil type and stencil width. The stencil types are
\verb|DA_STENCIL_STAR| and \verb|DA_STENCIL_BOX|. They are generalizations of the five
point and nine point stencils typical of two dimensional discretizations respectively. In
particular, \verb|DA_STENCIL_STAR| indicates that ghosted points (information owned by a
different processor) will be needed only along the coordinate axes while
\verb|DA_STENCIL_BOX| indicates that ghosted points will be needed in the box shaped
region surrounding each point. The stencil width indicates how many points in each
direction will be needed. We never need a stencil width greater than 1 and only need box
style stencils when gradient terms must be evaluated on a staggered grid ($h$ in SIA
velocity and $\bar{u},\bar{v}$ in computation of effective viscosity in Macayeal
velocity). We could keeping all other two dimensional vectors on a start type stencil
would reduce the necessary communication slightly, but would complicate the code. For this
reason, all two dimensional vectors are kept on a box type distributed array.

The three dimensional distributed arrays are aligned so that they have the same horizontal
extent as the associated two dimensional distributed array, but have complete vertical
extent. One point of confusion is the redefinition of the $x,y,z$ axes. Contrary to the
PETSc defaut, our $z$ axis changes most rapidly through memory while the $x$ axis changes
most slowly. That is, our C style arrays will be addressed as \texttt{u[i][j][k]} where
$\texttt{i,j,k}$ are the coordinate indices in the directions $x,y,z$ respectively. DA
based vectors can be accessed by \texttt{DAVecGetArray()} and restored with
\texttt{DAVecRestoreArray()}. The resulting pointer should be addressed using normal
multidimensional array indexing where values range over the global array.

PETSc DA based vectors can be ``local'' or ``global''. Local vectors include space for the
ghosted points. That is, when \texttt{DAVecGetArray()} is called, the resulting array can
be indexed on all the ghosted points. However, all vector operations act only on the local
portion. \texttt{DALocalToLocalBegin()} and then \texttt{DALocalToLocalEnd()} should be
called to update the ghost points before they will be needed. Global vectors do not hold
ghosted values, but array operations will act on the entire vector. Hence local vectors
typically need to be mapped to global vectors before viewing or using in a linear system.
This is achieved with \texttt{DALocalToGlobal()}.

\subsection{Solving linear systems}
PETSc is designed for solving large, sparse systems in a distributed environment.
Iterative methods are the name of the game and especially Krylov subspace methods such as
conjugate gradients and GMRES. For consistency, all methods use the Krylov subspace
interface. For this, the user declares an object of type \texttt{KSP}. Various options can
be set and the preconditioner context can be extracted. PETSc has an options database
which holds command line options. To allow these options to influence the \t{KSP}, one
should call \t{KSPSetFromOptions()} prior to solving the system. The default method is
GMRES(30) with ILU preconditioning.

To solve the system, a matrix must be attached to the \t{KSP}. The first time
\t{KSPSolve()} is called, the matrix will be factored by the preconditioner and reused
when the system is called for additional right hand sides. The default matrix format is
similar to the Matlab \t{sparse} format. Each processor owns a range of rows. Elements in
matrices and vectors can be set using \t{MatSetValues()} and \t{VecSetValues()}. These
routines use the global indexing and can set values on any processor. The values are
cached until one calls \t{MatAssemblyBegin()} followed by \t{MatAssemblyEnd()} to
communicate the values.

In the Macayeal velocity computation, the solution and right hand side vectors are not DA
based. The vector (field) components are interlaced and distributed. This seemed to be the
most straightforward method to solve the system (as opposed to using more advanced
features intended for multiple degrees of freedom on DA based vectors). This also allows
the matrix to have an optimal parallel layout.

\subsection{PETSc utility functions}
The \t{PetscViewer} interface allows PETSc objects to be displayed. This can be in binary
to disk, in plain text to the terminal, in graphical form to an X server, to a running
instance of Matlab, etc. Typically, one will want to view an entire vector, not just the
local portion, so DA based local vectors are mapped to global vectors before viewing. When
viewing multiprocessor jobs, the display may have to be set on the command line (ie.
\t{-display :0} or similar).

PETSc allows the programmer to access command line arguments at any time during program
execution. This is preferable to using \t{getopt.h} for this purpose. A convenient feature
is the \t{PetscBag} which is a serializable (can be written to disk) structure with
default values which can be set on the command line. A \t{PetscBag} is used for describing
the size of the grid. It is the first piece of data written to model state files so that
the program can start from the same state. Other options such as enhancement factors, ice
types and whether or not to use Macayeal velocity is not stored in a \t{PetscBag} at this
time.

Quite ellaborate error tracing and performance monitoring is possible with PETSc. All
functions return \t{PetscErrorCode} which should be checked by the macro \t{CHKERRQ()}.
Normally, runtime errors print traceback information when the program exits. If this
information is not present, you may need to use a debugger which is accessible with the
command line options \verb|-start_in_debugger| and \verb|-on_error_attach_debugger|. Also
consider options such as \verb|-log_summary| to get diagnostics written to the terminal.

\subsection{MPI}  MPI is a library which manages interprocessor communication for parallel computers.  One of the advantages of Petsc is that it calls MPI in a way that allows Petsc-using programs to be largely free of parallel communication details.


\section{Source code survey}

The class \t{IceModel} contains data members which are objects of type \t{IceGrid} and \t{IceType}.  This abstracts the choices of these objects to the
user.  Since there are only reference implementations of \t{BedrockType} and \t{OceanType},
these objects need not be passed into the \t{IceModel} at this time.  After the \t{IceGrid}
is set (it is changed by loading a previous state file for instance),
\t{IceModel::createVecs()} should be called. There is typically no need to explicitly call
\t{IceModel::destroyVecs()} since it is called by the destructor\dots

All ``\t{.cc}'' files in the release are C++ source files and ``\t{hh}'' files are C++ header files.  They have been compiled using the GNU compiler but should be highly portable.  Builds should be done by \t{make} in the directory \t{ice}; makefiles for this task and for \TeX-ing the manual are included in the release.

Regarding reasonable entry points into the code for the developer, note that \t{iceModel.hh} is the header file describing the core of the ice flow model.  Implementations of the \t{IceModel} methods are spread through a number of source files, including files named \t{iM*.cc}.  Important numerical calculations are performed by \t{iceModel.cc}, \t{iMvelocity.cc}, \t{iMtemp.cc}, and \t{iMmacayeal.cc}.  On the other hand, the \t{.cc} files \t{run\underline{ }ice.cc} and \t{verify.cc} each contain a \t{main} subroutine and are also good to look at from the beginning.
