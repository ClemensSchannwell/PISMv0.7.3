Inverse Problem Background
==========================

Suppose :math:`\calF` is a map from variables
:math:`\vd` to variables :math:`\vu`, i.e.

.. math: u = \calF(d)




The distinction between forward an inverse problems is that
inverse problems possess undesirable features.

Suppose 


Glibly, an inverse problem is the inverse of a forward problem.  




.. math:: R_j(\mathtt{U},\mathtt{d}) = 0
