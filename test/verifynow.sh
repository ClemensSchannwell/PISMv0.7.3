# VERIFYNOW is a script to do fairly quick verification of the isothermal and 
# thermocoupled shallow ice components of ice model COMMVNISM.  Uses only tests
# C and G.  Intended to do minimal amount of computation to show convergence 
# to continuum results.  Takes about [ABOUT 6 HOURS??! on my laptop]
