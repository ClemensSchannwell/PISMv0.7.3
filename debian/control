Description: PISM, a Parallel Ice Sheet Model
 The Parallel Ice Sheet Model project provides an open source, fully-parallel,
 high-resolution ice sheet model. It has these features:
 * a hierarchy of available stress balances, including shallow ice and shelf
   approximations, a hybrid of these, and a (planned) higher-order scheme
 * verification and validation tools
 * a polythermal, enthalpy-based conservation of energy scheme
 * extensible coupling to atmospheric and ocean models
 * complete documentation for users and developers
