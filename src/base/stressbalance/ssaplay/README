The old sources are for reference and ideas on modifications and new applications
of the SSA equations, though it is unlikely they will be looked at often, if ever.
None are currently being built with PISM.

iMinverse.cc,iMinverseMat.cc:  code attempts ad hoc inversion with SSA;
  replaced with principled version based on Maxwell's use of SSAFEM and siple

iceCalvBCModel.[hh|cc]: Contains early ideas about calving front
  forces.  The basic idea of a smoothed version of the (thk>0) mask, for calving
  front normal direction, is fine.  The matrix and rhs assembly is now (r1071)
  bogus and should not be used.  Instead of all of this: use PISM-PIK improvements.
  Note that exactTestM.[h|c] exact solution code remains in src/verif/tests/.
