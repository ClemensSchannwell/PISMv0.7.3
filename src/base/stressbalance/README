The classes here abstract both the SIA and SSA stress balances.
Here are some intended benefits:

1. make this part of PISM more "library-like", and reduced the Jed-named
   "large common block with inheritance" property of IceModel

2. clarify and complete the semantics of setting boundary conditions to the SSA
   (task #6567)

3. make it easier to improve the SSA calculation by appropriate use of
   SNES (task #4104)
   
4. make it easier to use the SSA in inverse mode, and allow the implementation 
   of David's and Marijke's tools for such

5. make it easier to implement the Pollard-deConto (task #6946) and Goldberg
   hybrids

6. make it easier to build a Blatter stress balance solver


Note:  a reasonable early software/verification test is to run test J "offline"
from IceModel.
