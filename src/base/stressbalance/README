The classes here abstract both the SIA and SSA stress balances.
Here are some intended benefits:

1. make this part of PISM more "library-like", and reduce the Jed-named
   "large common block with inheritance" property of IceModel

2. clarify and complete the semantics of setting boundary conditions to the SSA

3. make it easier to improve the SSA calculation by appropriate use of SNES
   
4. make it easier to use the SSA in inverse mode, and allow the implementation 
   of David's and Marijke's tools for such

5. make it easier to implement the Pollard-deConto (task #6946) and Goldberg
   hybrids

6. make it easier to build a Blatter stress balance solver
