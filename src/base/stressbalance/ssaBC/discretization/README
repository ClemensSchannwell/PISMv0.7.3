This directory contains files related to my (CK) attempt to document the
derivation of and re-generate coefficients of the SSAFD matrix.

It contains the following:

* formulas.tex: formulas generated by Maxima, used in ssa-discretization.tex

* ssa-discretization.tex: documentation

* ssa.mac: the definition of the finite-difference discretization of the SSA PISM uses

* ssa_code.mac: Maxima script generating C code that can be pasted into SSAFD::assemble_matrix()

* ssa_coeffs.mac: Maxima script computing coefficients of the discretization

* ssa_prettyprint.mac: Maxima code generating formulas.tex

* ssafd_code.cc and ssafd_pik_code.cc: C code generated by ssa_code.mac
