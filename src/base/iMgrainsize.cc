// Compute a grain size from a pseudo-age, which is determined only by the vertical velocity component.
/*
PISM allows the choice of the Goldsby-Kohlstedt flow law with option <tt>-gk</tt>.  
That flow law requires a grain size to compute the softness/viscosity.  To determine 
the grain size we use the Vostok core \lo\cite{VostokCore}\elo as a source for a 
universal relation between the age of the ice and its grain size; see grainSizeVostok().

By default we do not use the full model age, which takes a very long time
to equilibriate.  (If you want to use the full model age for this purpose add 
option <tt>-real_age_grainsize</tt>.)  Instead we compute a pseudo age which uses only 
the vertical (scalar) component of the velocity field and makes a steady state assumption.

In fact we solve this equation in each ice column:
     \f[w\frac{\partial a}{\partial z} \stackrel{\ast}{=} 1,\f]
where \f$a\f$ is the pseudo-age.  This represents a major simplification of 
the actual age equation
    \f[ \frac{\partial \tau}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial \tau}{\partial x}
        + v \frac{\partial \tau}{\partial y} + w \frac{\partial \tau}{\partial z} = 1\f]
which is solved in ageStep().  There are two simplifications, first that we 
assume steady state for the age field, and secondly that the horizontal velocity 
is assumed to be zero.  (Alternately we could explain dropping the
horizontal advection terms by assuming the age field does not vary in horizontal 
directions; each column is assumed to have the same age profile as its neighbor.)

The boundary value for the first order hyperbolic equation \f$\ast\f$ is 
\f$a(z=H)=0\f$, where \f$H\f$ is the elevation of the surface of the ice.  We 
work down the column from the top, using the downward velocity to add
to the age.  If at any point the vertical velocity is positive then we assume 
the ice is old below that level; in the Vostok time scale, for producing a 
grain size, ``old'' means \f$10^6\f$ years; see grainSizeVostok().

The numerical method is to approximate \f$\ast\f$ by
    \f[\left(\frac{w_k + w_{k+1}}{2}\right)\,
         \left(\frac{a_{k+1} - a_k}{z_{k+1}-z_k}\right) = 1.\f]
or
    \f[a_k = a_{k+1} - \frac{2(z_{k+1}-z_k)}{w_k + w_{k+1}}.\f]
This has second order truncation error (at \f$z_{k+1/2}\f$) whether or not 
vertical grid is equally-spaced.

//! Use the Vostok core as a source of a relationship between the age of the ice and the grain size.
/*! 
A data set is interpolated here.  The intention is that the softness of the ice has
nontrivial dependence on its age, through its grainsize, because of variable dustiness
of the global climate.  The grainsize is partly determined by at which point in 
the glacial cycle the given ice fell as snow.

The data is from \lo\cite{DeLaChapelleEtAl98} and 
\cite{LipenkovEtAl89}\elo.  In particular, Figure A2 in the former reference was
hand-sampled with an attempt to include the ``wiggles'' in that figure.  Ages of
the oldest ice (>= 300 ka) were estimated in a necessarily ad hoc way.  The 
age value of 10000 ka was added simply to give interpolation for very old ice;
ages beyond that get constant extrapolation.  Linear interpolation is done between
the samples.
