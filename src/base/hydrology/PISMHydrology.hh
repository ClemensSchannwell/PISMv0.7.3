//! \brief The PISM subglacial hydrology model interface.
/*!
This is a virtual base class.  The PISM default model is a derived class:
PISMTillCanHydrology.  Greatly-improved but computationally expensive mass-
conserving models are in PISMLakesHydrology and PISMDistributedHydrology.

PISMHydrology is a timestepping component (PISMComponent_TS).  Because of the
short physical timescales associated to liquid water moving under a glacier,
PISMHydrology derived classes may not use PISM's main ice dynamics time steps.
Instead, when (a derived class) PISMHydrology::update() is called it may advance
its internal time to the new goal t+dt using its own internal time steps.

Generally these subglacial hydrology models will use the ice geometry, basal
energy fields like basal melt rate, and the basal sliding velocity from IceModel
and other PISM classes.  These fields are normally treated as constant in time
during the update() call for the interval [t,t+dt].  Thus the coupling is
one-way during the update() call.

//! \brief The subglacial hydrology model from Bueler & Brown (2009) WITHOUT contrived water diffusion.
/*!
The name "till-can" comes from the following mental image:  Each map-plane cell
under the glacier or ice sheet does not communicate with the next cell; i.e.
there are "can walls" separating the cells.  The cans are "open-topped" in the
sense that they fill up to level bwat_max.  Any water exceeding bwat_max "spills
over the sides" and disappears.  Thus this model is not mass conserving, but it
is useful for computing a till yield stress based on a time-integrated basal
melt rate.

See [\ref BBssasliding] and [\ref Tulaczyketal2000b].  See this URL for a talk
where the "till-can" metaphor is illustrated:
  http://www2.gi.alaska.edu/snowice/glaciers/iceflow/bueler-igs-fairbanks-june2012.pdf

The paper [\ref BBssasliding] used this model but with contrived diffusion of
the water.  It is implemented in the derived class PISMDiffuseOnlyHydrology.

//! \brief A subglacial hydrology model which assumes water pressure is a fixed fraction of (or is equal to) overburden pressure.  Suitable for locations of subglacial lakes.
/*!
This model conserves water and transports it in the map-plane.  It was promised
in Bueler's talk at IGS 2012 Fairbanks:
  http://www2.gi.alaska.edu/snowice/glaciers/iceflow/bueler-igs-fairbanks-june2012.pdf

Subglacial lakes will occur in this model at local minimum of the hydraulic
potential (i.e. a linear combination of overburden pressure, the bed elevation,
and the water layer thickness).  Note that in this model the hydraulic potential
is the potential of the top of the aquifer.  Thus if water builds up
significantly (e.g. 10s of meters or more) then the resulting lakes diffuse
instead of becoming infinitely deep (i.e. we avoid delta functions at the minima
of the hydraulic potential).

This model should generall be tested using static ice geometry first, i.e. using
option -no_mass.

As with PISMTillCanHydrology and PISMDiffuseOnlyHydrology, the state space
includes only the water layer thickness W.  For more complete modeling where the
water pressure is determined by a physical model for the opening and closing of
cavities, and where the state space is both W and P, use PISMDistributedHydrology.
