//! The "local interpolation context" describes the processor's part of the source NetCDF file (for regridding).
/*!
The local interpolation context contains the details of how the processor's block
of the new computational domain fits into the domain of the netCDF file.  Note that each vertical column 
of the grid is owned by exactly one processor.

For any particular dimension, we have a new computational domain \f$[a,b]\f$ with
spacing \f$h\f$ so there are \f$n = (b - a) / h\f$ interior cells, indexed by \f$\{i_0, \dots, i_n\}\f$.
The local processor owns a range \f$\{i_m, \dots, i_{m'}\}\f$.  Suppose the netCDF file has
domain \f$[A,B]\f$, spacing \f$H\f$, and \f$N = (B - A) / H\f$ cells.  In order to interpolate 
onto these points, we need the indices \f$\{I_m, \dots, I_{m'}\}\f$ of the netCDF file so that

  \f[  [x(i_m), x(i_{m'})] \quad \text{is a subset of} \quad  [x(I_m), x(I_{m'})]  \f]

The arrays `start` and `count` have 4 integer entries, corresponding to the dimensions
\f$t, x, y, z(zb)\f$.
