The goal is to create a new class, in the first instance here
called StressBalanceSSA, to solve the stress balance without IceModel.
This relates to eliminating the Jed-named-property "large common
block with inheritance" of IceModel.  These are the intended benefits:

1. make it easier to optimize (specifically task #6868, item 1)

2. make it easier to improve the SSA calculation by appropriate use of
   SNES (task #4104)
   
3. make it easier to use the SSA in inverse mode

4. make it easier to build a Blatter derived class (morally, anyway)
   of it
   
Note that my goal is to get it matured enough so that I can run test
J "offline" from IceModel, before even starting to use it for IceModel.
