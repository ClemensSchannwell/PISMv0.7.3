This is a place to put under-development "tracer module" stuff.

A "tracer module" is going to be (presumably) a PISM class which uses
the velocity field produced by the rest of PISM to advect around tracers
like
  * ice age
  * fracture density (compare Albrecht & Levermann, 2011 (to appear))
A key idea is that these tracers do not diffuse.

This PISM class will presumably take advantage of the fact that the
ice velocity field in 3D is incompressible, namely
  div (u,v,w) = 0.
Because of that, the equations
  A_t + (u,v,w) . grad A = r.h.s.
and
  A_t + div((u,v,w) A) = r.h.s.
for some tracer with value A(t,x,y,z).  So the code can "take advantage"
of the fact that we can imagine
  q = (u,v,w) A
is a "conserved flux", up to changes from the r.h.s.

But note that a related class might also address the 3D enthalpy problem
(in which the there is vertical conduction but there is pure advection
in horizontal directions.  And a related class might address the 2D
(map-plane) pure advection problem actually addressed by Albrecht &
Levermann, 2011 (to appear), in which the map-plane 2D velocity field
is not incompressible (i.e. div (bar u,bar v) is not zero generally).
