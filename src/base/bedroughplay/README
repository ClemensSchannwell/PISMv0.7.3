These Matlab/Octave files evolved from Ed's codes used at the McCarthy 2010
summer school, which themselves evolved from Ed's codes used at Karthaus 2009.

They are here to provide a completely-independent test of the computation of
theta=theta(H,x1,x2), and an approximate computation of theta, from the theory
in
  C. Schoof (2003).  The effect of basal topography on ice sheet dynamics.
  Continuum Mech. Thermodyn. 15, pp 295--307.

To make various starts, run one of these:
  >> exampletheta
  >> testpade

This one will verify that the code siageneral.m is correctly implemented:
  >> verifynow
To make it work correctly, first run
  $ ./generate_testL.sh
in a shell.  This runs PISM four times to produce four gridded versions of exact 
Test L geometry in NetCDF format, with names testL_*.nc.  Then verifynow.m and
verifygeneralsia.m can read these---needs recent version of Matlab!---and use
them to compare to the numerical (siageneral.m) result.  Thus we have a way to
verify that the SIA is being solved correctly on a smoothed but non-flat bed.
In addition, verifynow.m and verifygeneralsia.m can use the Halfar solution to
verify the SIA with time-dependent exact margin location.
