//! \brief The PISM subglacial hydrology model interface.
/*!
This is a timestepping component (PISMComponent_TS) but it does not use PISM's
main timestepping.  Rather, when update() is called it advances its internal time
to the new goal t+dt using its own internal time steps.

Perhaps this will be a virtual base class.  There are two prospective implementations,
one being the old bwat diffusion currently implemented in iMhydrology.cc and the
other being the new van Pelt & Bueler model documented at
  https://github.com/bueler/hydrolakes

For now, it is just implementing the new model.

  A PISM component needs to implement the following I/O methods:
  \li add_vars_to_output(), which adds variable names to the list of fields that need
  to be written.
  \li define_variables(), which defines variables to be written and writes variable metadata.
  \li write_variables(), which writes data itself.
