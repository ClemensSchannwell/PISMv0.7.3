//! A derived class of PISMAtmosphereCoupler which has a simple snow process model suitable for Greenland modeling.
/*!
There are two parts to a "snow process model".
-# either a (snow/surface) temperature parameterization or stored (snow/surface)
   temperature maps,
-# a choice of PDD models, which convert the number of positive degree days, and
   the snow precipitation rate, into a surface mass balance (flux).

The default temperature parameterization is from \ref Faustoetal2009, directly
applicable to Greenland.  The constants can be changed, however, to describe other 
parameterizations which depend linearly on the same things (latitude, longitude,
and surface elevation).

If stored snow-surface temperature maps are used they are read through 
IceModelVec2T *snowtemps.

The PDD schemes are accessed through LocalMassBalance *mbscheme.
The default PDD model uses formula (6) from \ref Faustoetal2009, and uses a 
\ref CalovGreve05 evaluation of the expectation integral for the number of positive
degree days, given a normally-distributed daily variability.
An alternative PDD scheme simulates the daily variability directly by a normal
(pseudo-) random variable.

There is a severe simplification about temperatures implicit in this model for
computing inputs to IceModel.  Namely, vsurftemp is \e both the ice temperature
below completion of firn processes \e and it is used as "vsnowtemp_meanannual",
the mean annual temperature used in the snow processes model.
That is, the temperature in the snow processes model, an instance of LocalMassBalance,
which converts the snow precipitation rate vsnowprecip into surface mass flux vsurfmassflux,
is here assumed to be equal to vsurftemp.
    
The available temperature in real modeling is frequently the +2 m temperature, above
the snow surface, from an atmospheric flow/energy model.  So there are three temperatures:

-# the available 2m temperature (air)
-# the needed temperature for correctly modeling melting in the mass balance scheme, and
-# the needed temperature for the upper boundary of the conservation of energy scheme.

Here we just assume they are all the same, which is a deficiency of the model.
