as of 14 Jan 2009: 

These files are a PISMClimateCoupler demonstration.

There is an empty shell for a nontrivial PISMClimateCoupler.  There are
empty shell for PISMAtmosphereCoupler and PISMOceanCoupler, derived classes
of PISMClimateCoupler.

There is an empty shell of IcePCCModel, a derived class of IceModel, which
uses instances of PISMAtmosphereCoupler and PISMOceanCoupler.

A nontrivial PISMClimateCoupler for ice shelves was written by Ricarda 
Winkelmann (PIK), with help from Ed Bueler, on 2 Dec 2008.  That source is
in icerepo/Potsdam-Antarctica, a password-protected svn repo.  Contact Bueler 
for further info on that.
