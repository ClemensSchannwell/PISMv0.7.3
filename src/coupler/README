as of 14 Jan 2009: 

These files are a PISMClimateCoupler demonstration.

There is an essentially virual PISMClimateCoupler.  There are
derived classes PISMAtmosphereCoupler and PISMOceanCoupler.

There is demonstration implementation of IcePCCModel, a derived class 
of IceModel, using instances of PISMAtmosphereCoupler and PISMOceanCoupler.

A nontrivial PISMClimateCoupler for ice shelves was written by Ricarda 
Winkelmann (PIK), with help from Ed Bueler, on 2 Dec 2008.  That source is
in icerepo/Potsdam-Antarctica, a password-protected svn repo.  Contact Bueler 
for further info on that.
