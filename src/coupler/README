as of 8 Feb 2009: 

These files are a PISMClimateCoupler demonstration.

There is an essentially virtual PISMClimateCoupler.  There are
derived classes PISMAtmosphereCoupler and PISMOceanCoupler, but these 
are essentially intended as virtual too.

PISMConstAtmosCoupler and PISMPDDCoupler are used as very simplified atmosphere 
models.  They are attached to the IceModel instance by the driver.  See pismr.cc,
for example.

PISMConstOceanCoupler is the only (simplified!) ocean model provided with
the PISM source.  It is based on a nontrivial PISMClimateCoupler for ice shelves
which was written by Ricarda Winkelmann (PIK), with input from Bueler, on 2 Dec 2008.
That source is in icerepo/Potsdam-Antarctica, a password-protected svn repo.
Contact Bueler for further info on that.
