//! \brief A class implementing a constant-in-time surface model.  Reads data
//! from a PISM input file.
/*!
This is model is just as simple as PSSimple, but it assumes results from a
surface processes model are already known.  But they are treated as constant in
time and they are read from the input file at the beginning of the PISM run.

Specifically, these two fields are read from the \c -i or \c -boot_file file:
  \li \c acab = ice-equivalent surface mass balance
  \li \c artm = ice fluid upper surface temperature.

This surface model does not use an atmosphere model at all, so the
\c attach_atmosphere_model() method is null.  Any choice of PISMAtmosphereModel
made using option \c -atmosphere is ignored.  This may be an advantage in coupler
code simplicity.

Note that a very minimal coupling of an existing atmosphere and surface processes
model to the ice dynamics core in PISM could be accomplished by using this
PSConstant class for relatively short ice dynamics runs, each of which starts by
reading the latest \c acab and \c artm fields supplied by the atmosphere and
surface processes model.
