/*******************  ATMOSPHERE:  PISMAtmosphereCoupler ********************/

//! A basic derived class of PISMClimateCoupler for coupling PISM to an atmosphere model.
/*!
No files are read to initialize this class, so it is essentially a virtual base class 
for atmosphere model coupling.  No process modeling occurs.  It is expected that only
a derived class of this will actually be used.

Space for time-dependent surface mass flux (vsurfmassflux) and time-dependent surface
temperature (vsurftemp) is allocated.  A pointer to these is provided by appropriate
methods, and that is what IceModel needs.  IceModel has a pointer to an instance of this 
class in IceModel::atmosPCC;

The IceModelVec2 members vsurfmassflux and vsurftemp are exactly the surface fields needed 
as boundary conditions for IceModel.  In particular, vsurfmassflux is the instantaneous net
surface mass balance in ice-thickness-equivalent m s-1.  That is, vsurfmassflux is a term 
in the mass continuity equation.

The IceModelVec2 vsurftemp is the temperature (K) at the ice surface but below firn
processes.  E.g. the "10 m" temperature.  It is the upper surface boundary condition 
for the conservation of energy partial differential equation within the ice.

There is no temperature field present in this basic class which should be interpreted
as the snow temperature or the air temperature just above the surface.  Derived
classes may have that, and may model snow/firn processes.

A serious atmosphere model (CAM in CCSM, POTSDAM-2 in CLIMBER3alpha, etc) could run
non-trivially during these calls.  There might be a snow model in a PISMAtmosphereCoupler
component, or (for example) an existing land model might be used for snow processes.

There are no redefinitions of updateSurfMassFluxAndProvide() and 
updateSurfTempAndProvide().  Those procedures function the same way as in 
PISMAtmosphereCoupler, but here the effect is to provide access to 
IceModelVec2 s which are read once at the beginning of the run.
In particular, the default is to read fields vsurfmassflux and vsurftemp 
from a file at the beginning of the run and then not change them.

Other applications using this class will set the vsurfmassflux and/or 
vsurftemp fields from formulas.  Examples of this are verification cases
and certain simplified geometry experiments (e.g. EISMINT II).  In this 
case, set initializeFromFile=false before calling initFromOptions().
