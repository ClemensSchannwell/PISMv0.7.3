/*******************  ATMOSPHERE:  PISMAtmosphereCoupler ********************/

//! A basic derived class of PISMClimateCoupler for coupling PISM to an atmosphere model.
/*!
No files are read to initialize this class, so it is essentially a virtual base class 
for atmosphere model coupling.  No process modeling occurs.  It is expected that only
a derived class of this will actually be used.

Space for time-dependent surface mass flux (vsurfmassflux) and time-dependent surface
temperature (vsurftemp) is allocated.  A pointer to these is provided by appropriate
methods, and that is what IceModel needs.  IceModel has a pointer to an instance of this 
class in IceModel::atmosPCC;

The IceModelVec2 members vsurfmassflux and vsurftemp are exactly the surface fields needed 
as boundary conditions for IceModel.  In particular, vsurfmassflux is the instantaneous net
surface mass balance in ice-thickness-equivalent m s-1.  That is, vsurfmassflux is a term 
in the mass continuity equation.

The IceModelVec2 vsurftemp is the temperature (K) at the ice surface but below firn
processes.  E.g. the "10 m" temperature.  It is the upper surface boundary condition 
for the conservation of energy partial differential equation within the ice.

There is no temperature field present in this basic class which should be interpreted
as the snow temperature or the air temperature just above the surface.  Derived
classes may have that, and may model snow/firn processes.

A serious atmosphere model (CAM in CCSM, POTSDAM-2 in CLIMBER3alpha, etc) could run
non-trivially during these calls.  There might be a snow model in a PISMAtmosphereCoupler
component, or (for example) an existing land model might be used for snow processes.

/*!
There are no redefinitions of updateSurfMassFluxAndProvide() and 
updateSurfTempAndProvide().  Those procedures function the same way as in 
PISMAtmosphereCoupler, but here the effect is to provide access to 
IceModelVec2 s which are read once at the beginning of the run.
In particular, the default is to read fields vsurfmassflux and vsurftemp 
from a file at the beginning of the run and then not change them.

Other applications using this class will set the vsurfmassflux and/or 
vsurftemp fields from formulas.  Examples of this are verification cases
and certain simplified geometry experiments (e.g. EISMINT II).  In this 
case, set initializeFromFile=false before calling initFromOptions().

//! A derived class of PISMAtmosphereCoupler which has a simple snow process model.
/*!
There are two parts to a "snow process model".
-# either a snow-surface temperature parameterization or stored monthly
   snow-surface temperature maps,
-# a choice of PDD models, which convert the number of positive degree days, and
   the snow precipitation rate, into a surface mass balance (flux).

The default temperature parameterization is from \ref Faustoetal2009, directly
applicable to Greenland.  The constants can be changed, however, to describe other 
parameterizations which depend linearly on the same things (latitude, longitude,
and surface elevation).

If monthly snow-surface temperature maps are used they are read through 
MonthlyDataMaps  *monthlysnowtemps.

The PDD schemes are accessed through LocalMassBalance *mbscheme.
The default PDD model uses formula (6) from \ref Faustoetal2009, and uses a 
\ref CalovGreve05 evaluation of the expectation integral for the number of positive
degree days, given a normally-distributed daily variability.
An alternative PDD scheme simulates the daily variability directly by a normal
(pseudo-) random variable.
