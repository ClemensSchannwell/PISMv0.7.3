//! Class implementing the bed deformation model described in [\ref BLKfastearth].
/*!
  This class implements the [\ref LingleClark] bed deformation model by a Fourier 
  spectral collocation method, as described in [\ref BLKfastearth].  (The former
  reference is where the continuum model arose, and a flow-line application is given.
  The latter reference describes a new, fast method and gives verification results.
  See also [\ref BLK2006earth] if more technical detail and/or Matlab programs are desired.)
  
  Both a viscous half-space model (with elastic
  lithosphere) and a spherical elastic model are computed.  They are superposed
  because the underlying earth model is linear.

  The class assumes that the supplied Petsc Vecs are *sequential*.  It is expected to be 
  run only on processor zero (or possibly by each processor once each processor 
  owns the entire 2D gridded ice thicknesses and bed elevations.)
  
  This class SHOULD!
  include the scatter structures necessary to make this work in parallel.

  A test program for this class is pism/src/verif/tryLCbd.cc.
  
  Called by IceModel in pism/src/iMbeddef.cc.
