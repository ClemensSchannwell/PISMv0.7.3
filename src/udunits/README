This directory contains the stripped-down source code for the UDUNITS
(http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/) library, version 1.12.9.

Please see the file COPYRIGHT for the copyright information.

The main difference between this and the original version of UDUNITS is in the
build process: we don't use autoconf and we build a shared library, installed
*with* PISM, by default.

Also, the Fortran API is removed and all the sources generated using Perl, lex
and yacc are pre-generated to be able to compile the library without them.

As a consequence: blame me (CK) and *not* Unidata if it breaks.
