//! Implements an exact solution for basal melt rate.  Utterly straightforward arithmetic.
/*!
Assumes a steady-state temperature profile in ice and bedrock.  For this steady
profile there is an imbalance between the geothermal flux from the crust, namely
\c G which is equal (by construction) to the upward heat flux everywhere in the
bedrock thermal layer, and the heat flux upward in the ice, which is also a
constant everywhere in the ice.  This imbalance is balanced by the basal melt
rate \c bmelt (see equation below).

Geometry and dynamics context:  The top of the ice is flat so the ice
does not flow; the ice thickness has constant value \c H0.  The ice surface has
temperature \c Ts which is below the melting point.  The basal melt rate
\c bmelt does not contribute to the vertical velocity in the ice.  The ice
pressure is hydrostatic: \f$p = \rho_i g (h-z)\f$.

The basic equation relating the fluxes at the ice base and the basal melt rate
is from [\ref AschwandenBuelerBlatter],
  \f[ M_b H + (\mathbf{q} - \mathbf{q_{lith}}) \cdot \mathbf{n} = F_b + Q_b. \f]
Here \f$-M_b\f$ is the mass per area per time basal melt rate, so \c bmelt
\f$= - M_b / \rho_i \f$.  In the above equation the basal friction heating
\f$F_b\f$ is zero and the subglacial aquifer enthalpy flux \f$Q_b\f$ (namely the
heat delivered by the subglacial water to the base of the ice) includes no
horizontal velocity.  Also we assume the subglacial water is at the ice
overburden pressure \f$p_0=\rho_i g H_0\f$.  Finally, the temperate layer at the
base of the ice has zero thickness, so \f$\omega = 0\f$.  Thus
  \f[ H_l(p_b) = H_l(p_0) = H_s(p_0) + L, \f]
  \f[ H = H_s(p_0) + \omega L = H_s(p_0), \f]
  \f[ Q_b = H_l(p_0) M_b. \f]

The original equation for basal melt rate therefore reduces to
  \f[ \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{n} - G = M_b L \f]
or
  \f[ \text{\texttt{bmelt}} = -\frac{M_b}{\rho_i}
                = \frac{G - \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{n}}{L \rho_i}. \f]
On the other hand, the temperature in the ice is the steady-state result wherein
the upward flux is constant and the (absolute) temperature is a linear function
of the elevation \f$z\f$, so
  \f[ \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{n} = - k_i \frac{T_s - T_m(p)}{H_0}.\f]

This method implements these formulas, with both the goal of setting-up a
verification test (%e.g. by setting temperature at different elevations within
the ice and bedrock) and doing the verification itself (%e.g. checking against
the exact bmelt value).
