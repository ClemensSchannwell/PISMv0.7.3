/* 
   extrasGSL.[hh|cc] is a collection of procedures which use the GSL library for numerical 
   computations.  These are useful to the ice model but are not dependent on any members of the
   class IceModel.  A number of the procedures here mimic Matlab functionality: 
      interp1_linear, dblquad_cubature.
   
   The cubature program by Steven Johnson is used for double integration, rather than the iterated
   use of a single-variable adaptive rule as in Matlab's actual dblquad.  cubature.[h|c] by Johnson
   is based on HIntLib by Rudolf Schuerer as well on GSL itself.  Note cubature is distributed with GPL.
   
   The last heapsort code is not technically GSL, of course.
