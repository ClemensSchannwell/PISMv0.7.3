/* 
   extrasGSL.[hh|cc] is a collection of procedures which use the GSL library for numerical 
   computations.  These are useful to the ice model but are not dependent on any members of the
   class IceModel.  A number of the procedures here mimic Matlab functionality: 
      interp1_linear, dblquad_cubature.
   
   The cubature program by Steven Johnson is used for double integration, rather than the iterated
   use of a single-variable adaptive rule as in Matlab's actual dblquad.  cubature.[h|c] by Johnson
   is based on HIntLib by Rudolf Schuerer as well on GSL itself.  Note cubature is distributed with GPL.
   
   If the GSL library is not installed (in particular if one compiles with environment variable
   WITH_GSL=0), many of these codes return null results (of possibly reasonable kinds).
