This directory contains example PETSc-using source codes by the PISM authors.
Some are close to PETSc example codes anyway.  All of these examples relate to
"PETSc-technicalities" of relevance to PISM.

Among other uses, compiling and running these allows a user to test whether
PETSc itself is installed properly.  This is a way of testing
PETSc before building PISM.  These examples should work in PETSc 3.1 if it is
installed properly, even if other libraries needed by PISM are not yet
installed (e.g. NetCDF, FFTW).
