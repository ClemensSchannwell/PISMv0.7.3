ISMIP-HEINO is no longer supported as PISM functionality.

ELB believes revision 80 of PISM should be runnable for HEINO.

HEINO is not supported for reasons spelled out in appendix B of
   Ed Bueler and Jed Brown, 'The shallow shelf approximation as a "sliding law"
   in a thermomechanically coupled ice sheet model; submitted to JGR Earth Surface.
